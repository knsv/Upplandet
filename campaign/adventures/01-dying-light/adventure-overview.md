# Dying Light - Adventure Overview

**Setting:** Darkwood Cove, Green Shire County, Siven Kingdom
**Date:** October 12th, 649
**Party Level:** ~30 XP past character creation
**Themes:** Mystery, investigation, horror, witchcraft

## The Hook

The lighthouse beacon went dark overnight. Without it, ships cannot navigate the bay safely. Baron Lewis offers 1,000 silver crowns to anyone who lights the beacon and discovers what happened to the Browns (the lighthouse keepers).

## What Actually Happened

1. **Two years ago:** Livia Brown drowned. This awakened witch powers in her daughter Emma (age ~15)
2. **A few days ago:** Emma dug up her mother's grave to get a finger bone for a resurrection ritual
3. **Night before adventure:** Remillard caught Emma, locked her in the lighthouse basement
4. **That night:** Emma completed her ritual but her anger corrupted it - creating a banshee instead of resurrecting Livia. The banshee killed Remillard
5. **The baron's men came to investigate** - the banshee killed them too
6. **The banshee created the fog** to protect Emma

## Key Clues

| Location | Clue |
|----------|------|
| Beach | Michael (shipwreck survivor) - heard wailing, saw shadow |
| Village | Browns' tragic history, Emma's personality |
| Baron's mansion | Timeline of events |
| Church | Father Daniel can provide silver/potions |
| Browns' home | Bodies, journal revealing Emma's powers |
| Backyard | Disturbed grave |
| Lighthouse basement | Ritual circle drawn in blood |

## Emma's Motivations (for social encounter)

- **Desire (Love):** Wants her mother back for parental love
- **Fear (Isolation):** Terrified of being alone
- **Flaw (Anger):** Quick to anger, easily provoked
- **Strength (Curious):** Always asking questions, eager to learn

**Using these in social encounters:**
- Soothing her emotions weakens the banshee
- Exceeding half her Strain Threshold: Banshee Soak -1
- Exceeding full Strain Threshold: Banshee loses 1 rank of Adversary, fights alone

## Important Checks

| Check | Difficulty | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Knowledge (Forbidden) | Hard + setback | Identify banshee from Michael's description |
| Athletics | Average | Navigate the foggy bay |
| Fear check | Average | When encountering raised dead |
| Medicine | Average | Examine corpses |
| Social (vs. Daniel) | Opposed | Convince priest to provide gear |
| Social (vs. Emma) | Social encounter | Weaken banshee or resolve peacefully |

## Possible Endings

1. **Combat victory:** Kill banshee (and possibly Emma)
2. **Diplomatic:** Convince Emma to lift fog and leave
3. **Weakened combat:** Social encounter weakens banshee before fight

**Emma's fate options:**
- Execute her (religious characters)
- Help her escape/find new home
- Leave her to her fate (she may return as enemy)
