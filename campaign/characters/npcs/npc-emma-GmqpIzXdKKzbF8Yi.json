In fact, Vigilance is supposed to be used when your character doesn't expect a threat, isn't looking for a clue, or is otherwise unaware of something important. This is why we use it to {@rule determine Initiative} in combat when a character is surprised, to see how much that character was paying attention. It also means that when your GM asks you to make a Vigilance check, you may suspect that something is up. Your character, however, shouldn't be suspicious (unless they pass the check!) Vigilance is also one of skills that you use to oppose certain social skill checks (primarily {@skill Deception}) when those checks target your character.</p>",
