GENESYS  Introduction 4  H ello, and welcome to   Genesys , a roleplaying  game designed to empower you to create your  own world. In these pages you’re going to find the rules  to play the game, a wide variety of example settings,  and a toolkit that helps players customize the game and  make it their own.  But first, if you’re new to roleplaying games, let’s take  a minute to talk about what exactly this book is, and  what you’re going to do with it.  W hat   is   a   r oleplayin G   G ame ,   a ny W ay ?  So, a roleplaying game is a cooperative, improvisational  storytelling experience. You typically play a roleplaying  game with a group of friends, and the size of the group  can range from two to six people (or more). During the  game, you and your friends take on the role of a char -  acter in a fictional setting. You and your friends con -  tribute to telling a story in this setting and, in this story,  your characters are the main characters. They are the  heroes (or perhaps the villains) of the story you create.  What makes this a game, and not just a collaborative  storytelling event, are the rules. We call those rules the  Narrative Dice System, and we’ll get into more about  them later. The rules exist so that as you and your  friends play, you can introduce an element of risk and  randomness into your game. The drama of success or  failure at critical points in the narrative make the sto -  rytelling more fun. That element of risk (instead of just  saying “my character does this, and they succeed!”) is  the core point of the rules.  i ’   m   the   G   ame   m aster   ! W   hat   D   o   i   D   o   ?  Each group of players has one Game Master. If you’ve  decided to take on that role—congratulations! Being a  Game Master (or “GM”) is a lot of fun. You’re going to  run the game for your friends. This means you create  and present the plot of the story, describe the world,  and adjudicate the rules. You’ll need to think on your  feet, and respond to unexpected actions from your  players. Often, you may need to adjust your story when  your players make unexpected choices while play -  ing the game. Just remember, your ability to alter the  game and the story to take your players’ decisions into  account is what makes a roleplaying game unique.  Most importantly, your job is to make sure every -  one—including yourself—has a good time. This is  always more important than the rules.  i ’   m   a   p layer   ! W   hat   D   o   i   D o   ?  As a player, you’re going to take on the role of an indi -  vidual character. You’ll usually create a character to  play at the beginning of the game, and you control  their actions as they experience the adventure that your  friend the GM invents. It’s similar to episodes of a tele -  vision show or series of movies where you play the part  of one of a group of recurring cast members.  Adventures last for one or more game sessions. With  each adventure, your character becomes better at what  they do, and the story evolves as the characters make  choices and alter the world around them. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Introduction 5  h o W   D o   i   u se   t his   b ook ?  We designed   Genesys   to work with a wide variety  of settings, instead of just one. This can be your sci -  ence fiction roleplaying game, your fantasy roleplaying  game, or even your “fighting airship pirates in Victo -  rian England” game. We organized this book to facili -  tate these many options.  In   Part I   of this book, we cover the core rules of the  game, the Narrative Dice System. These are the rules  you’ll need to know to play   Genesys   in any setting,  from space opera to steampunk. With the exception of  our chapter on how to be a Game Master (Chapter 8),  Part 1   is the section that everyone should read.  In   Part II   of the book, we present five different exam -  ple settings in which you could run a game of   Gene -  sys . This isn’t an exhaustive list; that would require a  much larger book! However, we wanted these example  settings to show aspiring GMs what would go into cre -  ating their own setting, and give them some ideas to  get started. This section is mostly for Game Masters.  In   Part III , we present a whole lot of advice for GMs  who want to build their own rules and flesh out their  own settings. We also have some alternate rules that  you don’t need for all games of   Genesys , but should be  useful in some settings. This is our toolbox, and while  this section is mostly for GMs, we expect players will  want to read and learn some of these alternate rules.  You can create your own setting and run your own  game just using the material in this book. However, we  also designed it to be paired with setting supplements.  A setting supplement presents a single setting (with  new character options, items, adversaries, and environ -  ments) in more exhaustive detail, while relying on this  book to provide the core rules for playing the game.  W hat   D o   y ou   n ee D   t o   p lay ?  Playing   Genesys   requires very few materials. Besides  at least one copy of this rulebook (which, if you’re read -  ing this, you probably already own!), your group needs  pencils or pens and copies of the character sheets found  on pages 254-255 to record information about your  characters. Your group needs access to one or more  standard ten-sided dice. We recommend two ten-sided  dice per player, but if you don’t mind sharing, you can  get by with having two in the group.  You and your group should also use the custom  Genesys   Roleplaying Dice designed specifically to  manage the unique task resolution system used in the  game. We describe all of these dice in detail in   Part I  of this book.  You can buy packs of   Genesys   Roleplaying Dice at  local hobby game retailers or you can purchase them  online from www.FantasyFlightGames.com. We also pro -  vide a   Genesys   Dice app for iOS and Android devices. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules  6  C   ore   M   e C hani C s   8  C   reating   C   hara C ters   32  s kills   52  t alents   71  e quip M ent   82  C   o M bat   e n C ounters   95  s o C ial   e n C ounters   118  t he   g a M e   M   aster   125  I n the first part of this book, we introduce the rules.  You can think of them as the core of the game, or  the   Narrative Dice System portion of   Genesys . The  Narrative Dice System is basically the engine that  powers our game.  The rules presented in the first part of this book are  the core rules that you’ll use no matter what setting  your game takes place in. We intend for you to augment  these rules with the rules found in each individual set -  ting ( Part II   on page 136). Your   Game Master (GM)  may further augment the rules with rules of their own  devising, created using (or inspired by) the   GM Toolkit  section found in   Part III   on page 189 of this book.  W hat ’ s   in   t his   p art   of   the   b ook  Let’s go over what you’re going to find in this part of  the book.  •   Chapter 1: Core Mechanics.   This chapter describes  the basics of the game. If you want to learn how  to play   Genesys , start reading here. These rules  remain consistent no matter the setting.  •   Chapter 2: Creating Characters.   You need to build  characters to play this game. This chapter tells you  how with step-by-step instructions. Your game’s  setting may augment choices in this chapter.  •   Chapter 3: Skills.   From being charming to punch -  ing enemies in the face, skills define what your  character excels at doing.   Chapter 3   explains how  they work, and also lists all the skills you find in  our game. We also divide those skills depending on  what setting you should use them in.  •   Chapter 4: Talents.   Talents are special abilities that  let your character do unique things in the game. If  skills define the base of your character, talents are  the spice that makes your character interesting to  play and further sets them apart from others. Just  like skills, we give you a complete list of talents in  our game, and also like skills, we call out which tal -  ents make sense for particular settings.  •   Chapter 5: Equipment.   From guns and knives to  body armor and protein bars, equipment allows  your character to do stuff in the game that they  can’t do with bare hands. Even more than skills Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 7  and talents, equipment depends heavily on set -  ting. That’s why instead of providing a long list  of equipment, we just provide a couple of exam -  ples so you can see how the rules for equipment  work. Consult your game’s specific setting for a  more detailed list.  •   Chapter 6: Combat Encounters.   Genesys , like  most roleplaying games, provides a detailed set of  rules for resolving combat. These rules remain the  same no matter what setting you choose. How -  ever, a lot of other rules (such as rules for equip -  ment, skills, and talents) affect how your charac -  ter fights, so the feel of combat varies depending  on the setting. The fights are always governed by  the same basic rule set, though.  •   Chapter 7: Social Encounters.   The   opportu -  nity to talk your way out of problems sets RPGs  apart from other games. These rules cover how to  resolve social encounters. As in combat, the core  rules remain the same no matter what setting  you’re playing in.  •   Chapter 8: The Game Master.   If you’d prefer to  run a game, rather than play in it, then pay particu -  lar attention to this chapter. It covers all the basics  for a Game Master, including how to run adversar -  ies and other non-player characters (NPCs).  n arrative   p lay  G enesys   and the Narrative Dice System ask you to  step into your character’s role and use dramatic nar -  rative to describe events and advance a story. Through  this, you experience the excitement, drama, and epic  scope of an infinite variety of settings and adventures  from the perspectives of characters you create. While  we provide specific rules for how to resolve actions, our  game relies heavily on you and your Game Master to use  your imaginations—tempered with common sense—to  explain what happens.  In   Genesys , we represent combat and other situa -  tions in an abstract fashion. Our game focuses on your  characters and the heroic actions they take rather than  on measurements, statistics, or other minutiae. Instead  of taking a ruler and measuring the distance between  characters on a map, you simply need to state, “I’m  ducking behind the helicopter to get some cover while  I pull out my pistol.” That sort of description paints a  much better picture of the action taking place.  Action resolution also includes a narrative element.  The Narrative Dice System determines if a given task  succeeds or fails. However, the dice reveal more than  whether or not your character succeeds at something.  The different dice and their varied symbols tell a larger  story, adding depth and detail to the scene your char -  acters occupy.  Many dice resolutions set out to determine whether  a task succeeds or fails. However, the Narrative Dice  System goes beyond binary pass/fail results. It actually  contains six possible results, and most of those results  scale as well (for example, you can barely succeed, or  you can succeed really well). Even if your characters  fail, they may still make something good happen for  themselves or the rest of the party. However, even when  characters succeed, they may generate the seeds for  something dire later.  All this works to create some really interesting and  exciting encounters, and keeps you constantly engaged  with the game. Shared storytelling shapes the core of  Genesys . As you become more familiar with the sys -  tem, you can become as much a storyteller as your  Game Master. If you are the Game Master, you get to  run a game where your players are just as engaged with  creating the narrative as you.  p layer   C hara C ters   and  n on - p layer   C hara C ters  Throughout this book, we talk a lot about   player  characters   (or “PCs”) and non-player characters  (or “NPCs”). Player characters are the charac -  ters that players create and control, usually one  player character per player.  Non-player characters are everyone else in the  setting, from the bystanders in crowds to the evil  villain that the PCs have to defeat. The GM con -  trols all of the non-player characters. Most NPCs  are governed by rules that are far simpler than  the rules that govern a PC. Some are not gov -  erned by rules at all, and your GM describes all  of their actions narratively. This makes it easier  for your GM to run multiple NPCs at once. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 8  CHAPTER 1: CORE MECHANICS  W hether flying a fighter jet through a storm, sword-  fighting with an animated skeleton, or hacking  into a computer network guarded by killer AIs, your  characters often find themselves performing actions  that require skill and no small amount of luck. To deter -  mine whether these actions succeed or fail—or if they  have any other unforeseen consequences—characters in  Genesys   perform   skill checks. Skill checks are easy to  use, and we break them into two key elements:  1.   Roll a pool of Narrative dice.  2.   After all factors have been accounted for, if at least  one Success symbol remains, the task succeeds.  When any character attempts an action, the first step  involves gathering a number of dice and assembling  the dice pool. Several factors influence the number  and type of dice in the pool, including the character’s  innate abilities, skill training, and equipment, as well  as the inherent difficulty of the task being attempted.  Your GM may decide that the environment or the situ -  ation warrants the addition of certain dice; fixing a car  with ample time and the proper tools is one thing, but  attempting repairs in the pouring rain, without tools,  and under a hail of bullets is quite different. Once you  have assembled all of the necessary dice, you roll all of  the dice in the pool.  The second step involves interpreting the results  on the dice. After rolling, you look at the symbols on  the face-up sides of the dice. Certain symbols work in  pairs, one type canceling out another. Other types of  symbols do not cancel each other out, and their effects  are applied regardless of the outcome of the task. By  comparing the first set of paired symbols—Success  and Failure—you determine if the task succeeds. You  then compare the second set of symbols—Advantage  and Threat—to determine any beneficial side effects or  negative consequences. Finally, you resolve any other  symbols to add the last details to the outcome.  This core mechanic, the skill check, forms the foun -  dation of our game. Other rules and effects either  modify or interact with one of the two fundamental  elements—the assembly of the dice pool and the inter -  pretation of the results after the dice are rolled.  t he   d i C e  T his section takes a closer look at the Narrative  dice and their symbols. When the action starts  up, just about anything can happen. Dice symbols  provide a narrative framework for the action—did  your character hit their foe with a clean shot, or  force the opponent to scramble for cover instead  of attacking in return? Once you understand these  dice and symbols, you gain a better understanding  of our game’s core mechanic.  This section also tells you how to assemble a dice  pool and when to introduce extra dice based on the  circumstances. Dice sets can be purchased sepa -  rately, or players may use the   Genesys Dice App   to  roll them electronically.  When   your   character   makes   a   skill   check   in  Genesys , the dice allow you and your GM to quickly  determine a task’s success or failure, as well as its  magnitude and narrative implications. To accomplish  this,   Genesys   uses six types of dice. Each type fulfills  a specific function and purpose. Each die face is either  blank or features one or more symbols that represent  various positive or negative effects.  A typical dice pool contains somewhere between  five and eight dice. This pool size covers the major -  ity of situations. Difficult, complex, or epic situations  may include more dice, while mundane situations may Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 9  include fewer dice. If the task facing your character is  so easy that success is virtually guaranteed, you may  not need to roll dice at all! In fact, we recommend  that you limit generating and rolling a dice pool to the  important tasks that can influence the story.  In   Genesys , you can divide the types of dice into two  categories. The first type features dice with symbols ben -  eficial to accomplishing tasks. The second type features  symbols that cancel those beneficial symbols and hinder  the accomplishment of tasks.  Boost, Ability, and Proficiency dice are the beneficial,  positive dice. Setback, Difficulty, and Challenge dice  are the negative, disruptive dice (see   Table I.1–1: Posi -  tive and Negative Dice   above).  p ositive   Dice  Three types of positive dice have symbols that improve  the odds of successfully completing a task or achieving  beneficial side effects.  b oost   D   ice   󲊸  Special advantages, or “boosts,” are repre -  sented with light blue six-sided dice. Boost  dice   represent   benefits   gained   through  luck, chance, and advantageous actions  that your character takes. They reflect your character’s  possession of some sort of benefit or advantage, such  as having ample time to complete the task or having  the right equipment. Boost dice and Setback dice are  thematic opposites of each other. Boost dice are repre -  sented by   󲊸   in text.  a bility   D   ice   󲊷  Ability is represented with green eight-sided  dice. Ability dice form the basis of most dice  pools rolled by the players. They represent  your character’s aptitude or skill used when  attempting a skill check. These dice possess positive,  beneficial symbols. Ability dice are opposed by Diffi -  culty dice. Ability dice are represented by   󲊷   in text.  p roficiency   D   ice   󲊻  Proficiency   is   represented   with   yellow  twelve-sided dice. Proficiency dice repre -  sent the combination of innate ability and  training. They are most often used when  your character attempts a skill check using a trained  skill. Proficiency dice can also be added to a pool when  you spend a Story Point (see page   27 ) for an impor -  tant skill check. These dice possess a greater likelihood  of success, and they are the only dice that feature the  p ositive   d i C e   and   n egative   d i C e  Each dice pool consists of a number of dice from  several different sources. Essentially, these dice  pools contain “positive dice” and “negative dice.”  Positive dice are added to the pool to help accom -  plish a task or achieve beneficial side effects. These  may   reflect   innate   talents   or   abilities,   special  training, superior resources, or other advantages  that affect the specific task. Negative dice are added  to the pool to hinder or disrupt a task, or to intro -  duce the possibility of complicating side effects.  These may reflect the inherent difficulty of the task,  obstacles, additional risks, or the efforts of another  character to thwart the task.

Proficiency dice are rep -  resented by   󲊻   in text.  n e G ative   D ice  Three types of negative dice have symbols that under -  mine success or introduce unwanted complications.  s etback   D   ice   󲊸  In   Genesys ,   certain   complications,   or  “setbacks,” are represented with black six-  sided dice. Setback dice represent prob -  lems or minor obstacles during task resolution. Set -  back dice represent relatively minor conditions that  impair or hinder your character, such as poor lighting,  obstructive terrain, or insufficient resources. Setback  dice are not as potent as Difficulty dice. Add them to  represent additional circumstances or environmental  effects that would not in and of themselves increase the  base difficulty of the task. Setback dice and Boost dice  are thematic opposites of each other. Setback dice are  represented by   󲊸   in text.  D   ifficulty   D   ice   󲊷  Difficulty is represented with purple eight-  sided dice. Difficulty dice represent the  inherent challenge or complexity of a task  your character attempts to accomplish. In simplest  terms, the more Difficulty dice in a dice pool, the  harder it is to succeed. Difficulty dice possess negative,  harmful symbols that cancel out the positive, beneficial  symbols found on Ability, Boost, and Proficiency dice.  Difficulty dice oppose Ability dice. Difficulty dice are  represented by   󲊷   in text.  c hallen G e   D   ice   󲊻  Challenge   is   represented   with   dark   red  twelve-sided dice. Challenge dice represent  the most extreme adversity and opposi -  tion. These dice may be featured in place of Difficulty  dice during particularly daunting challenges posed by  trained, elite, or prepared opponents. Challenge dice can  also be added to a pool when your GM invests a Story  Point for an important skill check. These dice feature pri -  marily negative, obstructive results, such as Threat and  Failure, but they also feature the potent Despair result  (see page   24 ). Challenge dice are the upgraded version  of Difficulty dice (for more on upgrades, see page   21 ).  Challenge dice are represented by   󲊻   in text.  d i C e   b reakdown  In the following table, we’ve provided a break -  down of what faces show what symbol on each die.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 11  t en - s i D e D   D ice  In addition to the Narrative dice described above, the  game also uses standard   ten-sided dice. We abbreviate  these dice as “d10” in the text. Many standard d10s feature  a numeral zero (0) on one side. If a zero is rolled, it counts  as a ten. This allows the d10 to generate any number  between one and ten. You can find ten-sided dice at any  hobby game store, or on Fantasy Flight Games’ website.  In   Genesys , a more common roll using d10s is called  the percentile roll. When making a percentile roll, you  roll two dice, designating one die as the tens digit and  the other die as the ones digit. A result of zero on either  die means that the corresponding digit is zero in the  two-digit number rolled. A result of “00”—zero on  both dice—indicates a roll of 100. The percentile roll is  abbreviated as d100. It is used most often as a random -  izer, generating a number between 1 and 100. We use  Percentile rolls to generate numbers that correspond to  particular results on lookup tables. The one you’ll prob -  ably be most familiar with (and use most often) is   Table  I.6–10: Critical Injury Result   (see page   115 ).  d i C e   s y M bols   and   r esults  T he dice used in   Genesys   feature a number of  unique symbols used to determine success or fail -  ure, as well as to provide additional context and conse -  quences during task resolution.  We want to explain these symbols not just so you can  play the game, but also so you can help contribute to  the story. One of the unique aspects of the Narrative  Dice System is that you, not just your GM, can have the  opportunity to interpret the results of a skill check. You  can add subtle narrative flavor (“I heal 1 strain with  this Advantage   󲊴 , as I regain my breath and take a  moment to take stock of the battlefield”) or even major  cinematic changes to the scene (“what if, because of the  four Threat   󲊱   I rolled, our ship smashes into the reef  and we start taking on water?”)  This section introduces and defines the different  symbols, then describes how they are used in play. Just  like the Narrative dice, these symbols can be classified  into several broad categories. The two types of symbols  represent positive results and negative results.  p ositive   r esults  Let’s say your character hacks the internal computer  network of a government facility as they’re trying to  break in. How successful were they? Did your character  barely succeed in unlocking one electronic door, or did  they do so well that they quietly deactivated the entire  facility’s security systems? You determine these sorts of  specific details by interpreting the positive dice results  from a skill check.  You can find three positive symbols on the Narrative  Dice System Roleplaying Dice. These symbols repre -  sent Success, Advantage, and Triumph.  s uccess   󲊳  Success symbols   󲊳   are critical for determining whether  a skill check succeeds or fails; basically, the more Success  symbols   󲊳   you roll, the more likely the check succeeds.  Mechanically, one Success symbol   󲊳   is canceled by  one Failure symbol   󲊰 . Based on the core mechanic, if  at least one Success remains in the pool after all cancel -  lations have been made, the skill check succeeds. The  other thing to remember is that Success symbols   󲊳   can  also influence the magnitude of the outcome. The more  Success in a check after any symbols have been can -  celed out by Failure symbols   󲊰 , the greater the magni -  tude of the success (the more damage dealt, the more  people persuaded, or the more wounds healed).  Success symbols   󲊳   appear on   󲊸 ,   󲊷 , and   󲊻   dice.  a D vanta G e   󲊴  The Advantage symbol   󲊴   indicates an opportunity  for a positive consequence or side effect, regardless of  whether your character fails or succeeds at the task  they attempt. Examples of these positive side effects  include your character remaining unnoticed when  hacking a computer network, finding unexpected  cover during a firefight, or recovering from strain  during a stressful situation.  It’s possible for a task to fail while generating a num -  ber of Advantage symbols   󲊴 , allowing something  good to come out of the failure. Likewise, Advantage  can occur alongside success, allowing for significantly  positive outcomes. Remember, Advantage symbols   󲊴  do not have a direct impact on success or failure; they  only affect the potential side effects of the roll. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 12  Advantage is canceled by Threat. Each Threat symbol  󲊱   cancels one Advantage symbol   󲊴 . If a skill check  generates one or more net Advantage symbols   󲊴 , you  can spend that Advantage to apply one or more special  side effects. These could include triggering a Critical  Hit, activating a weapon’s special quality, recovering  strain, or even performing additional maneuvers. The  applications of Advantage are covered in more detail  on page   102   and   121 .  Advantage symbols appear on   󲊸 ,   󲊷 , and   󲊻   dice.  t riumph   󲊵  The Triumph symbol   󲊵   indicates a significant boon or  beneficial outcome. Each Triumph symbol   󲊵   provides  two effects:  First, each Triumph symbol   󲊵   also counts as one  Success, in every way Success   󲊳   has previously been  defined. This means that the Success generated by a Tri -  umph symbol   󲊵   could be canceled by a Failure symbol  󲊰   generated during the same skill check.  Second, you can spend a Triumph symbol to trigger  incredibly potent effects. You could think of this as a  “super Advantage,” although sometimes the effects are so  impressive that no amount of Advantage could trigger  them. Two common uses include triggering a Critical  Injury upon a successful attack and activating a weapon’s  special quality (in these cases, one Triumph can do the  same thing as many Advantage). Triumphs may activate  other potent effects as well, including effects above and  beyond those triggered by Advantage. These effects may  be set by the GM, or they may be defined by the environ -  ment, a piece of equipment, or a special character ability.  See pages   102   and   121   for more information on using  the Triumph symbol   󲊵   to trigger effects.  You gain both effects with each Triumph symbol, so  you don’t have to choose between the Success and the  special-effect trigger. Although the Success aspect of  the Triumph symbol   󲊵   can be canceled by a Failure  symbol   󲊰 , the second aspect of the   󲊵   result cannot be  canceled. Multiple Triumph symbols are cumulative:  each Triumph adds one Success, and each can be used  to generate its own special effect.  The Triumph symbol only appears on the   󲊻   die.  n e G ative   r esults  While racing away from enemy agents in a stolen  sports   car,   your   character   unsuccessfully   attempts  to weave between a pair of slow-moving trucks. Did  your character just scratch the paint on their new car’s  fender, or did you fail badly enough that your character  was forced off the road? Maybe you failed so badly that  your character ended up in a head-to-head collision  with a twenty-ton semi! You can find out by interpret -  ing negative dice symbols.  The Narrative dice include three negative symbols.  These results are Failure, Threat, and Despair.  f ailure   󲊰  Failure symbols   󲊰   are critical for determining whether  a skill check succeeds or fails. Basically, the more Fail -  ure symbols you roll, the more likely you are to fail!  Mechanically, one Failure symbol   󲊰   cancels one Suc -  cess symbol   󲊳 . Based on the core mechanic, if at least  one Success symbol   󲊳   remains in the pool after all can -  cellations have been made, the skill check succeeds. For -  tunately for your character, multiple net Failure symbols  󲊰   do not influence the magnitude of the failure.  Failure symbols appear on   󲊸 ,   󲊷 , and   󲊻   dice.  t hreat   󲊱  The Threat symbol   󲊱   is fuel for negative consequences  or side effects, regardless of whether your check suc -  ceeds or fails. Examples of these negative side effects  include your character taking far longer than expected  to pick a lock on a door, dropping their weapon as they  sprint for cover, or suffering additional strain during a  stressful situation.  It’s possible for a task to succeed while generating a  number of Threat symbols   󲊱 , which can cause some  minor or serious complications! Likewise, Threat can  occur alongside Failure, which can worsen an already  bad situation with some unforeseen headaches. You  should remember, however, that Threat symbols   󲊱  don’t directly impact success or failure, only their mag -  nitudes or potential side effects.  Your GM generally resolves Threat effects (although  when a non-player character generates some Threat, you  and your fellow players can and should suggest to your  GM some creative ways to spend that Threat!) Threat  may trigger a wide variety of possible effects. These  could include your character being knocked flat on their  back, losing the advantage of cover, taking more time  than anticipated to complete a task, suffering strain, or  giving an enemy an opportunity to perform a maneuver.  Threat cancels Advantage. Each Threat symbol   󲊱  cancels one Advantage symbol   󲊴 . We cover the applica -  tions of Threat in more detail on pages   103   and   121 .  Threat symbols appear on   󲊸 ,   󲊷 , and   󲊻   dice. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 13  D   espair   󲊲  The Despair symbol   󲊲   is a powerful result, indicating a  significant bane or detrimental outcome. Each Despair  symbol imposes two effects:  First, each Despair symbol   󲊲   also counts as one  Failure   󲊰 , in every way Failure   󲊰   has previously been  defined. This means that the Failure represented by a  Despair symbol   󲊲   could be canceled by a Success sym -  bol   󲊳   generated during the same skill check.  Second, each Despair can be used to trigger potent  negative effects. You could think of a Despair as a “super  Threat,” although sometimes the effects are so dire that  no amount of Threat could trigger them. Two com -  mon uses include having a weapon run out of ammo  and having a character slip and fall when attempting  to climb a rope or ladder. Despair may activate other  potent effects as well, including effects above and  beyond those triggered by Threat. These effects may  be determined by your GM or defined by the environ -  ment, an adversary, or a special character ability. See  pages   103   and   121   for more information on using a  Despair symbol   󲊲   to trigger effects.  You suffer both effects of each Despair symbol, so  you don’t get to choose between the Failure and the  special-effect trigger. The Failure aspect of the Despair  symbol can be canceled by a Success symbol   󲊳 ; how -  ever, the second aspect of a Despair symbol   󲊲   result  cannot be canceled. Multiple Despair symbols   󲊲   are  cumulative; each Despair imposes one Failure, and  each can be used to generate its own special effect.  The Despair symbol only appears on the   󲊻   die.  l ights , C a M era ,   a C tion !  D uring the course of your adventures, your characters  find themselves in countless situations, attempting a  variety of tasks. In everything from seemingly mundane  actions, such as repairing a car or negotiating the cost of  a box of rations, to extraordinary feats, like balancing on  the edge of a skyscraper in a rainstorm while fighting a  supervillain, your character is going to be put to the test.  When the outcome of your character’s attempt to accom -  plish a task is uncertain, you need to roll a skill check to  determine the task’s success or failure. These skill checks  hinge upon a number of different character attributes,  including skills, special talents, and inherent abilities.  Your GM decides what type of skill check is required  for a given task. Once the type of check and its difficulty  have been set, you assemble a pool of dice based on the  different factors involved. The pool can be a combina -  tion of many types of dice, which vary depending on  the characters involved and the specific situation.  After you assemble your dice pool, you roll all of the dice  in the pool. Then, you evaluate the dice results to deter -  mine which symbols cancel each other out and which  ones are cumulative. Once you’ve finished going over  the results, you and your GM resolve the skill check by  determining the action’s success or failure. You and your  GM use the information obtained from the dice results to  describe not only the outcome of the check, but also any  additional effects, complications, or surprises.  t he   b asi C   d i C e   p ool  G en e sys   uses a concept known as a dice pool,  which is a collection of the dice needed to deter -  mine the outcome of any given situation in the game  (see   The Dice , on page   8 ). While advanced or com -  plex actions may require a large dice pool, generally  your dice pools are going to be fairly simple. You cre -  ate a dice pool based on four factors: your character’s  inherent ability, any specialized training your character  has, the difficulty of the attempted task, and the equip -  ment your character uses.  Following a more detailed look at the first three fac -  tors (we talk about equipment in   Chapter 5 ), this sec -  tion describes how you assemble and resolve basic dice  pools, discusses other types of dice pools, and examines  the kinds of checks you might make during a game.  c haracteristics  In   Genesys , your character’s intrinsic abilities are  defined by six characteristics: Agility, Brawn, Cunning,  Intellect, Presence, and Willpower. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 14  Brawn and Agility represent your character’s physical  abilities: strength, flexibility, athletic prowess, skill with  weapons, and general toughness. Intellect and Cunning  represent mental abilities, reflecting your character’s  knowledge, analytical skill, cleverness, and deductive  reasoning. Willpower and Presence represent your  character’s personality and force of spirit, including  such aspects as charisma, mental fortitude, and facility  in relating to and interacting with others.  Your character’s species or archetype determines  their starting characteristic ratings. Due to quirks of  genetics or upbringing, some species or archetypes  start with different characteristics than others. You’ll  have the opportunity to increase these default char -  acteristics during character creation by investing a  portion of your character’s starting experience points  (see page   44 ). Just note that after character creation,  increasing characteristics requires a significant in-  game investment and can only be done by purchasing  a specific and expensive talent—something that might  happen only a few times over the course of an entire  campaign. You need to think carefully about your  character’s characteristic ratings, and should consider  investing a significant portion of their starting expe -  rience points (XP) in improving their characteristics.  Read more about character creation on page   32 .  Although it does make sense to focus on character -  istics that improve your character’s core skills and tal -  ents (if you’re going for a character who’s charming and  friendly, improving Charm and Presence are obvious  choices), our game system offers a great deal of flex -  ibility. You don’t need to have a 5 in your character’s  “primary” skill or characteristic to have a very good  chance of success. Also, if you devote too much of your  character’s XP into being great at one thing, you run  the risk of your character being terrible at everything  else that may happen in the course of the adventure!  C hara C teristi C   r atings  C haracteristic ratings for any character (your char -  acter or non-player characters) generally range  from 1 to 5. Some exceptions can exist, especially in  powerful or unique cases. However, for the most part,  we try to keep characteristics at 5 or lower, even for  those special situations.  Your typical human has an average characteristic rat -  ing of 2, so that’s what we consider the average baseline.  If your character has 2 Brawn, they’re about as strong  and fit as most people they meet on the street, and if they  have a 2 in Willpower, they only lose their temper occa -  sionally and usually stay awake during boring meetings.  Ratings of 1 are below average. A character with a  1 in Presence may be physically unattractive, or may  just be a jerk. Likewise, if your character has 1 Agility,  they’re probably clumsy and not very coordinated.  Ratings of 3 and up are above average, with a 3 being  notably above average, a 4 being significantly above  average, and a 5 being an exemplar of that character -  istic. So if your character has a 3 in Willpower, they’re  probably going to be more focused and determined than  those around them. If your character has a 4 in Agility,  they could have a career as a military sharpshooter or  a professional acrobat. And if your character has a 5 in  Cunning, they could match wits with Sherlock Holmes  or other great detectives of fiction and lore.  Your choice of species or archetype determines your  character’s starting characteristics, as explained on  page   35 . Now, although we’ve already talked a bit  about the six characteristics, let’s go over each one in a  little more detail.  a G ility  The Agility characteristic measures your character’s  manual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and body  control. Characters with a high Agility have flexibility,  a good sense of balance, and deft hands. Agility is used  for a number of physical skills, such as Coordination,  and it is key in ranged combat.  b ra W n  A character’s Brawn represents a blend of brute power,  strength, and overall toughness, as well as the ability  to apply those attributes as needed. Characters with  a high Brawn are physically fit and hardy, rarely get  sick, and have strong constitutions. Brawn is used for a  number of physical skills, such as Athletics and Melee.  Brawn is also used to determine your character’s start -  ing wound threshold. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 15  c unnin G  Cunning reflects how crafty, devious, clever, and cre -  ative your character can be. Characters with a high  Cunning are savvy, quickly pick up on vital social and  environmental clues, and can more readily come up  with short-term plans and tactics. Cunning is used for  a number of mental skills, including Deception, Per -  ception, and Survival.  i ntellect  The Intellect characteristic measures your character’s  intelligence, education, mental acuity, and ability to  reason and rationalize. Characters with a high Intel -  lect can extrapolate and interpolate data, can recall  details and draw from previous experience, and can  think of long-term strategies and envision the rami -  fications of present actions. Intellect is used for a  number of mental skills, including Knowledge, Medi -  cine, Mechanics, and Computers (if these are skills  included in your setting).  p resence  A character’s Presence characteristic represents their  moxie, charisma, confidence, and force of personality.  Characters with a high Presence make natural lead -  ers, draw attention when they enter a room, can easily  strike up a conversation with nearly anyone, and are  quick to adapt to social situations. Presence is the key  characteristic for interpersonal skills such as Charm  and Leadership.  W   illpo W er  The Willpower characteristic reflects your character’s  discipline, self-control, mental fortitude, and faith.  Characters with a high Willpower can withstand stress  and fatigue, remain composed during chaotic situa -  tions, and exert influence over the weaker willed. Will -  power is used for skills such as Coercion and Vigilance.  Willpower is also used to determine your character’s  starting strain threshold.  c haracteristics   in   p lay  Generally, most characters focus on some character -  istics over others, which helps define who they are.  Characteristics also influence skills, a wide variety of  character abilities, and some derived statistics. For  example, in addition to being used for Athletics and  Melee skill checks, Brawn determines a character’s  starting wound threshold and forms the basis of a  character’s soak value.  As we mentioned before, characteristics are one of  the four factors that affect the composition of a dice  pool for a check (the other factors being skill training,  task difficulty, and equipment and other incidental cir -  cumstances).  w hy   l i M it   C hara C teristi C s   to   5?  You may be wondering why we have a soft cap  on characteristics that keeps them limited to  a maximum rating of 5. After all, shouldn’t a  huge creature such as a dragon have a higher  Brawn, or a sentient AI supercomputer have a  higher Intellect?  One   reason   is   that   characteristics   directly  influence the size of the dice pool. The higher  the characteristic rating, the more dice you  roll. So, we try to keep characteristics maxed  out at 5 to limit the overall number of dice in  the pool and keep the physical act of rolling  them from being too awkward.  The other reason has to do with probability  of success. A pool with a mix of five Ability  󲊷   and Proficiency   󲊻   dice has a very good  chance of generating success on most checks  you’ll encounter in the game, and the prob -  ability only increases the more positive dice  you add. Since most difficulties in this game  are set values, setting a soft cap for characteris -  tics keeps checks from becoming a guaranteed  success—which can get boring or terrifying for  you, depending on whether your character or  your character’s adversaries are the ones with  the oversized dice pools!  When dealing with creatures that feel like they  should break the mold (like the dragon or  artificial intelligence mentioned earlier), the  important thing is to remember that there are  many ways to model inhuman strength, speed,  intelligence,   and   the   like   without   increas -  ing the creature’s characteristics. We go into  these details more on page   202 , where we talk  about how to build adversaries. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 16  s kills   and   t raining  W hile characteristics create the foundation of your  character’s abilities, skills and specialized train -  ing really make your player character (PC) stand out  from the crowd. Skills represent your character’s train -  ing and experience in performing specific tasks and  actions. Although characters can attempt almost any -  thing even without the proper training or skill, they are  far more likely to succeed if they have at least a rank or  two in the relevant skill.  Skills, the second factor influencing a dice pool,  represent specific training, hands-on experience, and  focused knowledge in a certain area. Each skill is linked  to a specific characteristic, which is the default ability a  character uses when performing a task with that skill.  For example, the Athletics skill is linked to Brawn,  Deception relies on Cunning, and Knowledge uses  Intellect. Proper skill training can compensate for a  character’s low characteristic rating. However, the most  proficient characters have both the proper training and  a strong linked characteristic.  For a more in-depth look at skills and their applica -  tions, see   Chapter 3: Skills , on page   52 .  d iffi C ulty  T he third factor in composing a dice pool (in addi -  tion to the relevant characteristic and related skill)  focuses on the difficulty of the task being attempted.  The characteristic and skill ranks add positive dice to  the dice pool. Difficulty adds negative dice, making  success less likely. In addition to dice that represent the  task’s inherent difficulty, other dice are added to reflect  further complications based on the environment or  specific situation.  While you determine the characteristic and related  skill based on the character attempting the task, your  GM sets the difficulty of all checks. There are six basic  difficulty levels, ranging from Simple (level 0) to For -  midable (level 5). Some modifiers and situations may  warrant checks higher than the fifth level, Formidable,  subject to your GM’s discretion (see the   Impossible  Tasks   sidebar, on page   18 , for information on an  optional additional difficulty level).  In addition to providing a general classification that  describes a task’s inherent challenge, the difficulty level  also tells you how many purple Difficulty dice   󲊷   you  should add to your dice pool. We refer to a task attempted  against a set difficulty level as a standard check.  D efinin G   t ask   D ifficulty  When used in a check to represent the challenge posed  by a task, the difficulty level is indicated with one of the  following labels: Simple, Easy, Average, Hard, Daunt -  ing, or Formidable. This label is followed in parenthe -  ses by the number of Difficulty dice   󲊷   to be added to  the dice pool. For example, you might face an   Easy ( 󲊷 )  Perception check   or a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Medicine check .  We’ve provided some more extensive explanations of  each difficulty level in this section.  We’ve also included the rough chance of success for  each difficulty. To calculate this, we’re assuming a start -  ing character with a characteristic of 3 and one rank  in the relevant skill, which adds two Ability dice   󲊷   󲊷  and one Proficiency die   󲊻   to the pool. This represents  a newly created character whose player has invested  enough experience in a certain skill and characteris -  tic to be reasonably confident of success. This is our  focused character—a character focused on accom -  plishing this kind of task. We’ve also provided a starting  character with a characteristic of 2 and no ranks in the  skill; this is our general character—a character with no  particular skill at accomplishing the task.  s imple   t asks   (–)  A   Simple task represents something so basic and rou -  tine that the outcome is rarely in doubt. We assume that  your character succeeds at most of the Simple tasks they  attempt (our focused character succeeds on a Simple  check more than 90 percent of the time, and even the  general character succeeds 75 percent of the time). Gen -  erally, your character isn’t required to make a check if  the task is so simple that your character is guaranteed  to succeed. However, sometimes there is a slight chance  of failure (even a check with no difficulty dice can fail if  you don’t roll any Success   󲊳   results), or sometimes there  are no consequences for failure, but you need to know  the magnitude of your character’s success. In these cases,  your GM may require you to make a Simple check. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 17  A Simple task adds no Difficulty dice to the skill  check’s dice pool.  e asy   t asks   ( 󲊷 )  An   Easy task poses little challenge to most characters, but  something could still go wrong, and failure remains pos -  sible. We assume that a character with the proper train -  ing and resources for a situation can expect to succeed at  most of the Easy tasks they attempt (a focused character  succeeds on an Easy check almost 80 percent of the time,  and even a general character should succeed about 60  percent of the time). Often, the magnitude or potential  side effects are more uncertain than the success itself.  An Easy task adds one Difficulty die ( 󲊷 ) to the skill  check’s dice pool.  a vera G e   t asks   ( 󲊷   󲊷 )  An   Average task represents a routine action for which  success is common enough to be expected, but failure is  not surprising. We assume a character with the proper  training, resources, and approach to the situation should  expect to succeed at Average tasks more often than they  fail (our focused character succeeds on an Average check  about two thirds of the time, but our general character  succeeds slightly less than half the time).

Success is certainly feasible,  but failure is far from surprising. A typical character  with the proper training, resources, and tools for the  situation should still expect fail a Hard check almost as  often as they succeed (our focused character succeeds  at Hard tasks just over half of the time, and our general  character only succeeds about a third of the time).  Hard tasks are challenging enough that you that  before attempting them, you should consider improv -  ing your character’s chances by equipping them with  specific tools, purchasing specific talents, or purchasing  additional ranks in the appropriate skill. You could also  spend a Story Point to upgrade the check and increase  your character’s chances.  A Hard task adds three Difficulty dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) to  the skill check’s dice pool.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 18  D   auntin G   t asks   ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  A   Daunting task taxes a character, pushing them to  their limits. Success may be difficult to achieve, but  it’s certainly possible. We expect that a typical charac -  ter with the proper training, resources, and tools for  the situation likely fails more often than they succeed  at Daunting tasks (our focused character succeeds on  Daunting checks about 45 percent of the time, while  our general character succeeds only a quarter of the  time). The typical character also runs a significant risk  of generating lots of Threat   󲊱   even if they succeed.  A Daunting task adds four Difficulty dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  to the skill check’s dice pool.  f ormi D able   t asks   ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  Formidable tasks seem nigh impossible, and if you  don’t take them seriously, your character may find them  insurmountable. However, with proper planning, a  well-trained and well-equipped character has a chance  at success. Typical characters often fail at Formidable  tasks (our focused character succeeds only one third  of the time, and our general character has a less than  20 percent chance of succeeding). Even highly trained  characters fail Formidable tasks more often than they  succeed. If you need to make a Formidable check, you  should make sure your character has all the advantages  (in the form of proper gear, aid from others, and maybe  Story Points) that they can find.  A Formidable task adds five Difficulty dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷  󲊷   󲊷 ) to the skill check’s dice pool.

In almost all cases, your GM simply  states that any such check automatically fails  without your needing to assemble and roll a  dice pool.  However, your GM may decide to allow your  player character (PC) to attempt a check for  which   success   is   extremely   improbable:   for  throwing a grenade in hopes that it puts out a  fire, scaling a perfectly smooth wall, or trying  to tame a mother bear when you find yourself  between her and her cubs, for instance. If you’re  the GM, you should only allow a PC to attempt  an Impossible task during critical moments in a  story’s arc or in life-or-death situations.  If you want to attempt an   Impossible task, you  must spend one Story Point just to attempt  the check. Your character gains no benefits for  doing so, beyond being able to attempt the task  in the first place (and you cannot spend any  additional Story Points on the check). Once  you’ve done so, an Impossible task adds five  Difficulty dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) to the pool, the  same as a Formidable task. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 19  b uilding   a   b asi C   d i C e   p ool  N ow that we’ve discussed the three primary building  blocks of a skill check’s dice pool, let’s go over how  you actually assemble the dice   pool.  When your character wants to attempt some sort of  action that might have a chance of failure, you make a  skill check. The skill check uses the character’s appropri -  ate skill: Athletics for breaking down doors, Knowledge  for recalling facts, or Charm for convincing a guard to let  the character enter a restricted facility, for example. Each  skill also has a linked characteristic: Brawn for Athlet -  ics, Intellect for Knowledge, and Presence for Charm, for  instance. To make a skill check, you assemble a dice pool.  There are two sides to every basic dice pool: the side to  which you, the player, contribute (in the form of Ability  dice   󲊷   and Proficiency dice   󲊻 ) and the side to which your  GM contributes (in the form of Difficulty dice   󲊷 , Chal -  lenge dice   󲊻 , Boost dice   󲊸 , and Setback dice   󲊸 ). Addi -  tional factors may modify the number and type of dice for  a check, but note that the GM sets the difficulty level of  the task once, prior to the roll. After creating the base dice  pool, either side may have the opportunity to upgrade dice.  a pplyin G   s kills   an D   c haracteristics  A character’s ranks in a skill and ranks in the character -  istic linked to the skill are equally important in building  a dice pool. When your character attempts a task, you  and your GM figure out what skill is most appropriate  for your character to use to accomplish the task. Note  that since skills are linked to characteristics, once you  figure out what skill to use, you’ll know what character -  istic to use. For example, if your character is attempt -  ing to bypass a security terminal by cutting some wires,  the skill check would use the Skulduggery skill, which  is linked to the Cunning characteristic. The ratings for  these two attributes determine the number of Ability   󲊷  and Proficiency dice   󲊻   that you add to the dice pool.  Once you know the proper skill and characteristic,  you can start building your dice pool. To add dice to  the pool, you compare your character’s ranks in the  skill to the linked characteristic’s rating.  The higher of the two values determines how many  Ability dice are added to the skill check’s dice pool.  Then, you upgrade a number of those Ability dice equal  to the lower of the two values. ( Upgrading   means you  remove the Ability die   󲊷   from the pool and replace it  with a Proficiency die   󲊻 .) If your character is unskilled  (possesses no ranks) in the necessary skill, then the  lower value is automatically zero, and your character  does not upgrade any dice. (This also applies if the  character has a zero in the corresponding character -  istic; however, in practice, it’s almost impossible for a  character to have a zero in a characteristic.) EXAMPLE 2: KATIE’S CHECK  Later, Katie must attempt to climb down the same  cliff, following Kendra’s path. Katie spends more time  at the gym training, and she has an Athletics skill of  3 because of it. However, her Brawn is only 2. Katie’s  Athletics skill is higher, so the player begins by adding  three Ability dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) to the pool. Katie’s Brawn  rating is lower, so the player upgrades that many dice  (two) into Proficiency dice ( 󲊻   󲊻 ). To attempt this  action, Katie starts out with three dice in her pool:  󲊷   󲊻   󲊻   (one Ability die and two Proficiency dice).  You may have noticed that both Kendra and Ka -  tie have the same size and type of dice pool, even  though their Brawn ratings and ranks in the Ath -  letics skill are different. Our system allows a char -  acter to compensate for a lack of innate ability by  improving their skills, and vice versa. EXAMPLE 3: REX’S CHECK  Finally, Rex, the wildlife researcher who got the three  characters into this mess, tries to climb down the cliff  and escape the grizzly bear as well. Rex has Brawn  2, but no ranks in the Athletics skill. His Brawn is  higher, so the player begins by adding two Abil -  ity dice ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) to the pool. Since he has no ranks in  Athletics, that value is considered to be zero, and no  Ability dice are upgraded into Proficiency dice. To  avoid being eaten by bears, Rex starts out with only  two dice in his dice pool:   󲊷   󲊷   (two Ability dice). EXAMPLE 1: KENDRA’S CHECK  Kendra is trying to climb down a rocky cliff to escape  from a vicious grizzly bear. This check uses Kendra’s  Athletics skill and Brawn characteristic. Kendra has  Athletics 2 and Brawn 3. Her Brawn is higher, so the  player begins by adding three Ability dice ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  to the pool. Kendra’s Athletics skill is lower, so the  player upgrades that many dice (two) to Proficiency  dice ( 󲊻   󲊻 ). To attempt the climb, Kendra starts out  with three dice in her pool:   󲊷   󲊻   󲊻   (one Ability die  and two Proficiency dice). Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 20  a pplyin G   t ask   Difficulty  After determining which skill and related characteristic  your character uses to attempt a task, your GM then  chooses the level of difficulty for the task by consult -  ing   Table I.1–3: Difficulty Levels , on page   18 . The  difficulty level of the task determines the number of  Difficulty dice you must add to the pool. For example,  an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )   skill check means you add two Dif -  ficulty dice to the dice pool.  In some cases, your GM may upgrade one or more  of these Difficulty dice by removing them from the  dice pool and replacing them with an equal number of  Challenge dice   󲊻 .   Difficulty dice are usually upgraded  into Challenge dice when your character faces skilled  opposition or particularly challenging circumstances,  or when your GM invests a Story Point to make a check  more challenging.  After your GM sets the difficulty level for the task,  you add the corresponding number of Difficulty dice  to the task’s dice pool. If no other factors influence  the outcome of the attempt, the basic dice pool is now  complete, and you can roll it to determine success or  failure, as well as any potential side effects.  m o D ifyin G   a   Dice   p ool  It’s entirely possible that if nothing else could affect the  outcome of the check, the dice pool contains just the  Ability dice and Proficiency dice from your character’s  skill and characteristic, matched against the Difficulty  dice determined by your GM. However, any number  of other factors can influence your check. Maybe your  character is trying to track a foe through a howling  sandstorm, or maybe bright lights in a room silhou -  ette the villain, giving your character a clear shot. If an  action is important enough to assemble and roll a dice  pool, there’s a good chance other factors are involved.  These other factors can affect or modify the dice pool  in a number of ways. The most common ways are by  adding dice, upgrading/downgrading dice, and remov -  ing dice. These modifications may be triggered by you  or your GM, or they may simply make sense given the  environment and situation. Here are a few examples of  these factors: obstructing terrain, poor lighting, tacti -  cal advantages, time constraints, superior equipment,  special talents, unlocked career abilities, investment of  Story Points, and Critical Injuries. The following sec -  tions describe these modifications in more detail.  It’s also important to note that when modifying a  dice pool, players perform the modifications in a spe -  cific order. First, players assemble the basic pool, and  then they add additional dice. Next, they upgrade dice.  Then they downgrade dice. Finally, they remove dice.  a DD in G   D   ice  One way to modify the basic dice pool is to add dice to  reflect environmental conditions or various advantages  and disadvantages. Generally, we do this by adding  Boost and Setback dice.  As a general rule, your GM adds one   Boost die   󲊸   to the  dice pool for each bonus that could help your character  succeed, and one   Setback die   󲊸   for each impediment or  disadvantage that hurts your character’s chances.  A single Boost die   󲊸   represents the benefits provided  by such things as useful gear, ample time to prepare,  superior position, or the element of surprise. Your GM  may add multiple Boost dice if your character benefits  from more than one of these advantages.  Likewise, a single Setback die   󲊸   reflects the impact  of detrimental or obstructing effects like poor lighting,  inferior supplies, a harsh environment, or outside dis -  tractions. If your character is unlucky enough to suffer  from more than one of these setbacks, your GM may  add multiple Setback dice to the pool.  i n C rease ,   u pgrade ,   or   a dd ?  If you’re the GM, there may be times when you’re  not sure whether you should increase the diffi -  culty of a check, add negative dice, or upgrade  the existing negative dice.  First, you should set the difficulty based on the  task itself, not on the circumstances surround -  ing that specific attempt at the task. In general,  once set, the difficulty level remains the same,  regardless of who, what, when, or why that par -  ticular task is attempted.  Upgrading (or downgrading) dice is not usually  necessary unless a specific rule or ability calls for  it. These situations are defined by the individual  abilities and are generally not applied arbitrarily  by the GM.  There may be some unique or noteworthy circum -  stances surrounding the task. To represent these  circumstances, you may decide to add Boost or Set -  back dice. Added dice should reflect the elements  that make this attempt distinct or special. As a gen -  eral rule, if the GM feels that a skill check has dis -  tinct factors that could modify the outcome, they  should consider using Boost and Setback dice. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

It’s important to note that while these dice are essen -  tially mirror opposites in their use, Boost dice and Set -  back dice do not cancel each other out. If the situation  warrants the addition of two Boost dice and one Setback  die, you add all three dice ( 󲊸   󲊸   󲊸 ) to the dice pool.  All players can use Boost dice and Setback dice to help  reinforce important elements of the story. You should  describe your character’s actions in detail, pointing out  both advantages and disadvantages that may influence a  particular action. As you do, your GM should recognize  when a particular detail offers a noticeable advantage  and add a Boost die   󲊸 . After all, part of the idea is to  reward good storytelling on everyone’s part.  Of course, sometimes the description you or your GM  comes up with makes it more appropriate to add a Set -  back die   󲊸   to the pool. When that happens, embrace  it! If your GM is doing their job right, they’re already  looking for places where it makes sense to add Setback  dice to your checks. So all you’re doing is helping your  GM make the   󲊸   addition more narratively appropriate.  Some equipment may add Boost dice   󲊸   to a pool  to   reflect   superior   crafts -  manship,   while   your  character’s talents may  allow you to add Boost  dice   󲊸   to a pool to reflect  special training or aptitudes  that   apply   to   the   situation.  Maneuvers like aiming may also  allow you to add Boost dice   󲊸   to a  pool. Conversely, some effects may  specifically impose Setback dice   󲊸 ,  such as the defined effects of a Criti -  cal Injury or a penalty for using infe -  rior tools for a delicate task.  While you may (and should!) offer  up suggestions for adding Boost and  Setback dice to your checks, your  GM is the final arbiter, deciding which  and how many dice to add to the pool.  Your GM bases what dice to add on some  helpful guidelines we’ve provided. The  GM should always use common sense,  taking into account the way the scene  and action have been described. See  the   Positive Dice and Negative  Dice   sidebar,   on   page   9 ,   for  examples of the types of situ -  ations that may warrant the  addition of Boost or Set -  back dice.  u p G ra D in G   an D   D o W n G ra D in G   D ice  Game effects can “improve” dice, basically by letting  you remove a die with a lower probability of generat -  ing results from your pool and replacing it with a die  that has a higher probability for results. Likewise, game  effects can “degrade” a die, removing a die with a high  probability of generating results and replacing it with a  die with a lower probability for results. (Note, we said  “results,” not “success” or “failure.” Both of these effects  can apply to positive and negative dice.)  We call improving a die upgrading, while weakening a  die is called downgrading. Beyond the upgrading based  on your character’s ranks in a skill or characteristic  (see   Applying Skills and Characteristics , page   19 ),  upgrading and downgrading dice most often occurs  when you or your GM spends a Story Point to increase  the chances of a skill check succeeding or failing. Your  character may also have certain talents or other special  abilities that allow you to upgrade or downgrade dice. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 22  u p G ra D in G   D   ice  Upgrading dice is a mechanic specific to Ability dice  and Difficulty dice, and these are the only two types of  dice that can be upgraded. When you upgrade an Ability  die   󲊷 , you remove the die and replace it with a Profi -  ciency die   󲊻 . When you upgrade a Difficulty die   󲊷 , you  remove the die and replace it with a Challenge die   󲊻 .  When a special talent or effect calls for one or more dice  to be upgraded, first you need to determine how many dice  are to be upgraded. Once you determine this, you remove  that number of Ability dice   󲊷   or Difficulty dice   󲊷   from  the pool and replace those dice with an equal number of  either Proficiency dice   󲊻   or Challenge dice   󲊻 . When an  effect requires you to upgrade dice, the rules always state  whether to replace Ability dice   󲊷   or Difficulty dice   󲊷 .  u p G ra D in G   m ore   D   ice   than   a vailable  Sometimes you may need to upgrade Ability dice into  Proficiency dice but you have no more Ability dice (the  pool has nothing but Proficiency dice in it). In this case,  you perform the following steps. First, you determine  how many upgrades you still need to perform. Then,  using one upgrade, you add one additional Ability die  󲊷   to the pool. If any upgrade opportunities remain, you  then upgrade the newly added Ability die   󲊷   into a Pro -  ficiency die   󲊻 . You then repeat this process until you’ve  performed all of the upgrades you need to perform.  If you need to upgrade Difficulty dice into Challenge  dice but you have no more Difficulty dice (the pool has  nothing but Challenge dice in it), you’re going to follow  the same process. First, you add one additional Difficulty  die   󲊷 ; then, if any more upgrades remain, you replace  the Difficulty die   󲊷   with a Challenge die   󲊻 , and so on.  D   o W n G ra D in G   D   ice  Downgrading dice is also a specific mechanic, and it  applies only to Proficiency dice and Challenge dice.  When you downgrade a Proficiency die   󲊻 , you remove  the die and replace it with an Ability die   󲊷 . When you  downgrade a Challenge die   󲊻 , you remove the die and  replace it with a Difficulty die   󲊷 .  Special talents or effects may call for one or more  dice to be downgraded. If you have to perform mul -  tiple downgrades, you first determine how many dice  you need to downgrade. Once you determine this, you  remove that number of Proficiency dice   󲊻   or Chal -  lenge dice   󲊻   from the pool and replace them with an  equal number of either Ability dice   󲊷   or Difficulty dice  󲊷 . When an effect requires you to downgrade dice, the  rules always state whether Proficiency dice   󲊻   or Chal -  lenge dice   󲊻   are to be downgraded.  D   o W n G ra D in G   m ore   D   ice   than   a vailable  There may be situations where you need to downgrade  more Proficiency dice   󲊻   into Ability dice   󲊷   or Chal -  lenge dice   󲊻   into Difficulty dice   󲊷   than are available.  If, as you are downgrading dice, there are no more Pro -  ficiency dice   󲊻   or Challenge dice   󲊻   left to downgrade,  any further downgrades are ignored.  This takes a different approach from upgrading,  where you continue adding more dice if there are no  more Difficulty   󲊷   or Ability   󲊷   dice left. We did this on  purpose; if downgrading dice let you remove Ability   󲊷  or Difficulty   󲊷   dice, it would overlap with the rules for  adding and removing dice. We go into those rules later.  u p G ra D es   an D   D   o W n G ra D es   in   the   s ame   p ool  Sometimes you end up with various talents or abili -  ties that mean you need to apply both upgrades and  downgrades to the same dice pool.

For example, the Dodge talent allows you to  upgrade the difficulty of a combat check that tar -  gets your character by a certain value. Upgrad -  ing or downgrading the ability of a pool refers to  upgrading Ability dice   󲊷   into Proficiency dice   󲊻  or downgrading Proficiency dice   󲊻   into Ability  dice   󲊷 . Likewise, upgrading or downgrading the  difficulty of a pool refers to upgrading Difficulty  dice   󲊷   into Challenge dice   󲊻   or downgrading  Challenge dice   󲊻   into Difficulty dice   󲊷 .  u pgrade   versus   i n C rease  Upgrading Difficulty dice   󲊷   in a dice pool is dif -  ferent than increasing a skill check’s difficulty.  Increasing   or   decreasing   difficulty   is   simply  a measure of how many Difficulty dice   󲊷   are  added to the initial dice pool; we cover this in  more detail on page   16 . Upgrading Difficulty  dice   󲊷   into Challenge dice   󲊻   is generally trig -  gered by a special ability or the investment of  Story Points by one of the participants.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 23  downgrades second. This is important, since upgrad -  ing dice could add more dice to the overall pool, and  the higher number of dice would remain the same after  you apply any downgrades.  r emovin G   D   ice  Just like some effects add Boost dice   󲊸   or Setback dice  󲊸   to a pool, some effects remove dice from the pool  before you even roll them. Most often, this is a result  of talents that allow the removal of Setback dice   󲊸   (for  instance, the Knack for It talent on page   73 ). However,  some talents or other effects may remove   󲊸   from your  skill checks as well; these are just a bit less common.  The individual talent or effect describes under what  circumstances you remove the dice, as well as the num -  ber and type of dice you remove. If an ability calls for  the removal of more dice of a type than there are in  the dice pool, all of the dice of that type in the pool are  removed, and any additional removals are ignored.  Remove dice after all other dice have been added and  all upgrades and downgrades have been applied.  i nterpreting   the   p ool  A fter you roll a dice pool, you and your GM evalu -  ate the results to resolve the outcomes. The first  outcome to resolve is the success or failure of the skill  check. Then, you both determine if any significant side  effects—good, bad, or both—are triggered. After all, one  of the great things about our system is that when you  make a check, just about anything can happen!  s uccesses   an D   f ailures  When you roll a skill check, if the results include both  Success symbols   󲊳   and   Failure symbols   󲊰 , count up  the total number of each type of symbol and then com -  pare those two numbers. Each Failure symbol   󲊰   cancels  one Success symbol   󲊳 . After you make all the needed  cancellations due to Failure symbols   󲊰 , a pool of one or  more Success symbols   󲊳   or one or more Failure sym -  bols   󲊰   remains, or those symbols evenly cancel out.  During this step, it’s important to note that a Tri -  umph symbol   󲊵   contributes one Success   󲊳   to the  pool, in addition to any special effects it may trigger.  Likewise, a Despair symbol   󲊲   contributes one Failure  󲊰   to the pool, in addition to its special effects.  If all Successes   󲊳   and Failures   󲊰   in the pool are  canceled out, or if any net Failures   󲊰   remain, the skill  check fails. If at least one Success   󲊳   remains, the skill  check succeeds.   Remember, a dice pool must have  at least one Success symbol   󲊳   remaining for a skill  check to succeed.  a D vanta G e   an D   t hreat  It’s also likely for the results of your skill check to include  some   Advantage symbols   󲊴 ,   Threat symbols   󲊱 , or both.  If this is the case, you add up the total number of Threat  symbols   󲊱   and compare that number to the total number  of Advantage symbols   󲊴 . Each Threat symbol   󲊱   cancels  one Advantage symbol   󲊴 . After all Threat symbols   󲊱  have canceled Advantage symbols   󲊴 , a pool of one or  more Advantage symbols   󲊴   or one or more Threat sym -  bols   󲊱   remains, or those symbols evenly cancel out.  Having one or more net Advantage symbols   󲊴   indi -  cates a positive side effect or benefit. Having one or  more net Threat symbols   󲊱   indicates a negative side  effect or complication. If all the Advantage   󲊴   and  Threat   󲊱   symbols cancel each other out, then there  are no additional effects in your challenge. The posi -  tive and negative side effects can occur regardless of  whether the check succeeds or fails.  You can use Advantage   󲊴   and Threat   󲊱   to activate  a wide variety of side effects. Generally, you (the player  rolling the skill check) choose how to spend Advantage  󲊴 . Some of the ways you could spend Advantage   󲊴  include triggering a weapon’s special quality, perform -  ing an additional maneuver, or recovering some strain.  Various weapons, talents, and equipment may have  special ways to spend Advantage   󲊴 .  Generally, your GM chooses how to spend Threat   󲊱  to impose some sort of complication. The more Threat  󲊱   the GM spends, the more severe the complication.  Some of these complications can include suffering  strain, providing an opportunity to an opponent, fall -  ing prone, being subjected to environmental effects, or  having a task take longer to complete than expected.  Various talents, environments, and opponents may  have special ways to spend Threat   󲊱 .  For more about using Advantage and suffering from  Threat, see pages   102 ,   103 , and   121 .  r oun D in G   u p  Some rules may as you to calculate a fraction of a result.

t riu M ph   and   d espair  W e’ve mentioned these two symbols before, but let’s  talk about them in more detail here. Triumph   󲊵  and Despair   󲊲   have more powerful effects on the game  and work slightly differently than the other symbols.  Unlike Success and Failure ( 󲊳   and   󲊰 ) or Advantage  and Threat ( 󲊴   and   󲊱 ), Triumph and Despair ( 󲊵   and  󲊲 ) do not completely cancel each other out. Instead,  each indicates an especially positive or unfortunately  dire side effect for your character’s check.  Remember that it’s possible for a skill check to result  in both   󲊱   and   󲊲   symbols.  In   this   case,   you   should  interpret   both   results  separately.   As   with  Threat, it’s possible for  a skill check to suc -  ceed but still impose  a Despair effect, or fail but still trigger a Triumph effect.  For more about the specific applications of Triumph  and Despair, see pages   102 ,   103 , and   121 .  t riumph   󲊵  A   Triumph symbol   󲊵   has two effects. First, each Tri -  umph symbol   󲊵   counts as one Success symbol   󲊳 . Sec -  ond, a Triumph result indicates an unexpected boon  or significantly beneficial effect related to the check  your character just made. Many weapons and talents  have side effects that can be triggered using a Triumph  result. Otherwise, the scenario or your GM may pres -  ent further options for using Triumph.  It’s important to keep in mind that while a Triumph  symbol   󲊵   does add a Success symbol   󲊳   to the pool,  the presence of one or more Triumph symbols   󲊵   does  not automatically mean that the check succeeded.  You can think of Triumph as an enhanced, more  powerful version of Advantage. For example, a  single Triumph symbol   󲊵   can trigger any  weapon’s special quality or inflict a Crit -  ical Injury, while without a Triumph,  these effects require a certain number  of Advantage symbols   󲊴 . Also, while  Advantage may allow your character to  heal strain, in the right situation, a Tri -  umph   󲊵   may allow them to heal a wound.  D espair   󲊲  A   Despair symbol   󲊲   also has two effects. First,  each Despair symbol   󲊲   counts as one Failure  symbol   󲊰 . Second, a Despair result indicates an  unfortunate   consequence,   significant   complica -  tion, or dire effect related to the check your char -  acter just made. The opponent’s abilities, the envi -  ronment, or the encounter description may offer  different options for using Despair. Otherwise,  your GM adjudicates the results of Despair sym -  bols   󲊲   based on the situation.  It’s important to keep in mind that while  a Despair symbol   󲊲   does add a Failure  symbol   󲊰   to the pool, the presence  of one or more Despair symbols   󲊲  does not automatically mean the skill  check has failed. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 25  You can think of Despair as an upgraded, more  potent form of Threat. For example, a single Despair  symbol   󲊲   may trigger effects that would normally  require several Threat symbols   󲊱 . Despair may be  significant enough to inflict wounds instead of strain,  cause an important piece of equipment to break, make  a weapon jam or run out of ammo, or, when coupled  with failure, make a grenade explode in the user’s hand.  u nlimite D   p ossibilities  With the opportunity for success or failure, as well as  the myriad side effects made possible through one or  more Advantage, Threat, Triumph, or Despair symbols,  no two skill checks are the same. Whenever you make  a skill check, you have dozens—if not hundreds—  of possible outcomes. Your character may achieve a  high-magnitude success with no other complications,  a low-magnitude success with Advantage, or a mod -  erate success with Advantage that is tempered with  Despair. Likewise, a failed check may have a silver lin -  ing if accompanied by Advantage or Triumph, or it may  create a truly dire situation when accompanied by both  Threat and Despair.  The sheer number of possibilities provides opportu -  nities to narrate truly memorable action sequences and  scenes. Nearly anything can happen in the heat of the  moment; even a single rocket fired at a futuristic land  tank might hit some critical component that results in  its destruction. We encourage you to take these oppor -  tunities to think about how the symbols can help move  the story along and add details and special effects that  create action-packed sessions.  o ther   t ypes   of   C he C ks  A s you play, you’ll be using the standard skill check  and basic dice pool to resolve the vast majority  of tasks your character encounters in a game session.  However, there are some situations you’ll need other  types of checks to resolve. Are the characters involved  in a high-stakes negotiation, competing with multiple  factions for their goal? Or are they racing to escape the  clutches of enemy agents hot on their trail? In addition  to the standard skill check,   Genesys   uses opposed  checks, competitive checks, and assisted checks.  You use opposed checks when the success or failure  of a task is strongly influenced by an opponent’s skill.  You use competitive checks to determine which char -  acter performs better when two or more characters are  attempting the same task. Assisted checks represent  simple variations of other checks, but with two or more  characters working together.  o ppose D   c hecks  An   opposed check occurs when someone tries to pre -  vent your character from succeeding, or when your  character tries to overcome or get past another char -  acter. For example, if your character lies to someone,  your character’s Deception check may be opposed by  the opponent’s Vigilance.  You should use an opposed check when a task involves  directly opposing the task that another character per -  forms, or when a task involves trying to go unnoticed,  undetected, or undiscovered by someone else. This  means you most often use an opposed check when your  character tries to influence someone socially (whether  that’s by lying, charming, or intimidating), when your  character tries to avoid notice (perhaps trying to sneak  past someone or pick someone’s pocket), or in similar  situations. Specifically, you use an opposed check when  the action your character wants to perform is opposed  by a single individual.  Like standard checks, opposed checks add   󲊷   and poten -  tially   󲊻   to the check’s dice pool. However, instead of being  determined by your GM, the difficulty is determined by  the skills and characteristics of the opposing character.  To build the dice pool, you start out following the  same procedures as those for building a regular dice  pool. You add   󲊷   based on your character’s relevant skill  or characteristic, then upgrade some   󲊷   into   󲊻   based on  the other value. You then look at the opposing character,  and you and the GM determine what skill that character  would use to oppose the task your character is trying to  perform. Look at the skill and linked characteristic, then  determine which one has the higher value. Add an num -  ber of   󲊷   equal to the higher value to the pool, then take  the lower value and upgrade a number of   󲊷   to   󲊻   equal  to that value (see   Upgrading Dice   on page   22 ).  In essence, you form the difficulty of the pool in the  same way that you would form the ability of a pool, but  replacing   󲊷   with   󲊷 , and   󲊻   with   󲊻 .  We write out an opposed check as an   opposed Skill  Name versus Skill Name check . The first skill is the  skill your character uses, and the second skill is the skill  being used to oppose the check. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 26  c ompetitive   c hecks  Competitive checks occur when several characters  try to accomplish the same goal at the same time or  try to determine who performs a task better than  another. When multiple characters attempt the same  task, and you need to determine who accomplishes  the task first or performs it better, or to measure  some other outcome, the characters are engaging in  a competitive check.  For example, two characters engage in a friendly  arm-wrestling contest. Each one has the same goal:  to win the match by pinning the opponent’s arm. The  winner can be determined through a competitive  check to see who outperforms the other. Additional  examples include several runners competing in a race,  or multiple politicians trying to win over an unde -  cided crowd during a debate session.  For a   competitive check, your GM assigns a dif -  ficulty level for the task, and each player who has a  character involved in the competition makes a skill  check using that difficulty. When characters make a  competitive check, it’s important to track how many  total   󲊳   they generate with their respective dice pools.  The character with the most total   󲊳   “wins” the check.  If none of the characters succeed at the check, then  none win, and the competitive check results in a draw.  If two or more characters generate the same number  of   󲊳 , the check goes to a tiebreaker to see if the draw  can be resolved.  Although   󲊴   and   󲊵   still provide their customary  effects in these situations, they also provide one addi -  tional benefit. If the two characters tie with the number  of net   󲊳   they generate, the character with the greater  number of   󲊵   becomes the winner. If the characters  are also tied for number of   󲊵 , the character with more  total   󲊴   is declared the winner.  If the characters are still tied after evaluating these  categories, the competitive check is a draw. In this  case, your GM may simply appoint a winner, declare  that all tied parties have lost, resolve the draw with  another competitive check, or find some other way to  settle the competition.  We write out a competitive check as a   competitive  Difficulty (Level) Skill Name check .  a ssiste D   c hecks  Some tasks are important or challenging enough that  your   character   requires—or   at   least   appreciates—  some help! Fortunately, characters can—and should—  provide assistance to each other in performing a variety  of tasks. Over the course of normal narrative play, pro -  viding assistance is easy. You explain how your char -  acter wants to help with a task. If the explanation is  reasonable, your GM may allow that assistance. There  are two types of assistance that you can provide: skilled  assistance and unskilled assistance.  s kille D   a ssistance  Assistance works best when the assisting party brings  additional insight or expertise to the task. When a  character with a higher characteristic or skill rating  provides assistance to another character, the dice pool  may use one character’s characteristic and the other  character’s skill rating. EXAMPLE 4: OPPOSED CHECK  Rex, the wildlife researcher from our previous  examples, is trying to sneak up on a cougar with -  out being detected. Rex has Agility 4 and Stealth  2, building an initial dice pool of four Ability dice,  two of which are upgraded to Proficiency dice  ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊻   󲊻   in total). The cougar has a Willpower  of 1, but a Vigilance of 2. Therefore, the opposi -  tion adds two Difficulty dice ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) to the check,  one of which is subsequently upgraded to a Chal -  lenge die ( 󲊻 ). If there is nothing else that affects  the check, here’s what the dice pool looks like:  󲊷   󲊷   󲊻   󲊻   󲊷   󲊻 . EXAMPLE 5: COMPETITIVE CHECK  Ellie and Michael are racing motorcycles through  the crowded streets of New York, each attempt -  ing to reach the Brooklyn Bridge first without  being caught by the police. Their GM decides  that the race requires a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Driving  check . Ellie has Agility 3 and Driving 2, while  Michael has Agility 2 and Driving 1. Ellie gener -  ates   󲊳   󲊳   󲊴   󲊴 . Despite his inferior Agility and  Driving, Michael also manages to succeed, gener -  ating   󲊳   󲊵   󲊱   󲊱   󲊱 . Michael wins the competi -  tive check based on the tiebreaker (since   󲊵   also  counts as a Success), and he gets to the bridge first  while losing a pursuing cop car in traffic.  However, Ellie also has   󲊴   󲊴   to resolve, while  Michael has   󲊱   󲊱   󲊱   to deal with. Perhaps even  though Michael evaded them, the police got a good  look at him and put out a bulletin for his arrest.  Meanwhile, Ellie displayed some pretty impressive  driving skills: so much so that word gets back to a  local biker club, and they offer her a membership! Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 27  u nskille D   a ssistance  If the assisting party does not have a higher char -  acteristic or skill rating, so that using either rating  would provide no benefit to the other character, your  GM may add   󲊸   to the dice pool (representing the  fact that the additional assistance is still providing  some benefit).  a ssistance   r estrictions  The GM can require that certain conditions be met  in order for player characters or other parties to offer  assistance. To assist in tending to an injury, the assist -  ing character might need to be next to the patient, or  to assist with translating an ancient book, the assisting  character might need to have access to the book.  Generally, only one character can provide assistance  at a time. However, your GM may decide that certain  situations can accommodate more people. In this case,  only one assisting character can offer their characteris -  tic or skill rating, and all other participating characters  contribute   󲊸   to the check.  a ssistance   an D   t imin G  During combat or structured encounters, when Ini -  tiative and the order in which characters act is more  important, assistance can be accomplished by perform -  ing the assist maneuver. The assist maneuver allows an  engaged ally to benefit from assistance provided by the  acting character on the ally’s next skill check. Assistance  lasts only until the assisted character’s next activation.  For more on the assist maneuver, see page   98 .  o ther   k ey   e le M ents  E ven when things are at their worst, your characters  are capable of rising above adversity to face chal -  lenges head on. Whether they are shrugging off wounds  that would kill lesser folk, manifesting strange magical  or psychic powers, or calling on their experiences to do  things “regular” people simply couldn’t, your character  and the characters of your fellow players are a breed  apart. This section describes a number of key elements  that help define your character and set them apart from  everyone else. These elements include character talents,  Story Points, experience and development, and derived  attributes such as wound and strain thresholds.  t alents  Whereas skills represent what your character knows,  disciplines they have practiced, or experience they have  applied in a particular area, talents exemplify a much  broader class of special ability. Talents represent vari -  ous tricks, techniques, and knacks that your character  has picked up over the course of a career or reflect their  sheer determination to get things done. Each talent rep -  resents a distinct special ability that provides the PC with  an edge in certain situations. Keeping a rickety old air -  ship together with a combination of determination and  baling wire, inspiring allies in the face of a hurricane,  and knowing just where to hit a rampaging bull in order  to take it down are examples of talents at work.  Talents are divided into several categories and are  either active or passive. Active talents typically require  you to state that your character chooses to use them.  Some active talents have a cost or requirement associ -  ated with them, such as investing a Story Point, suffer -  ing strain, or using the talent as part of an attack action.  Other talents are passive, meaning they are always “on”  and don’t need to be activated by you. Passive talents  either constantly provide their benefit or automatically  trigger under certain circumstances.  Some talents belong to a series of related talents.  These series may comprise either lower-level talents and  their improved versions or identical talents taken mul -  tiple times for a cumulative effect. In the former case,  an improved version of a talent completely replaces or  upgrades the lower-level version. In the latter case, the  talent is measured with a series of ranks. The more times  your character takes the talent, the more ranks it has and  the greater the magnitude of its effects.  s tory   p oints  Your character (and any other player character) is cut  from a different cloth than most NPCs who populate  the setting. Not only do they have access to skills and  special talents to help them succeed, but PCs are also  intimately connected to destiny, fate, or whatever you  like to call it. Destiny is that special spark that elevates  heroes above commoners, imbuing an individual with  enough significance in the game’s events to be a player  character. Over the course of the PCs’ adventures, fate,  fortune, or destiny can intervene on their behalf for  good or ill. Destiny might manifest in a positive way  and provide a temporary advantage or boost to your Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 28  PC’s abilities. Or destiny might prove an ill omen and  impose additional hardships and complications. In any  case, your characters are the heroes of the story, and we  want the game to reflect that.  The concept of fate and the player characters’ ability  to tap into and influence this resource is represented  by Story Points. Story Points are resources that can be  invested by you and your GM for a variety of differ -  ent effects. For example, you can use Story Points to  upgrade Ability dice   󲊷   or Difficulty dice   󲊷 , or to trig -  ger certain talents or special abilities.  t he   t W o   s tory   p ools  In the game, there are two pools of Story Points. You  and your fellow players can spend Story Points from  the player pool. Your GM can spend Story Points from  the Game Master pool.  p reparin G   the   s tory   p ools  Each pool can be delineated on the table by drawing  a pair of circles on a sheet of paper, or by simply des -  ignating two areas of the table as the player pool and  the GM pool. At the beginning of the session, you and  your group add one Story Point to the player pool for  each player. Then, your GM adds one Story Point to the  Game Master pool.  t rackin G   s tory   p oints  You can use just about any small items to represent  Story Points. Some suitable items are gaming tokens,  glass beads, coins, and poker chips. You can also buy  suitable gaming tokens from the Fantasy Flight Supply  line, found at   www.FantasyFlightGames.com .  h o W   s tory   p oints   a re   u se D  You, your fellow players, and your GM can all tap into  destiny by spending the Story Points in the right pool.  It’s important to note that you and your fellow players  may only spend Story Points in the player pool, and  your GM may only spend Story Points in the Game  Master pool.  When you or another player spends a Story Point,  you remove it from the player pool and add it to the  Game Master pool. Likewise, when your GM spends a  Story Point, they remove it from the Game Master pool  and add it to the player pool.  The point gets moved after you have resolved the  action in which you spent the Story Point. This way,  players or Game Masters cannot immediately spend a  Story Point that has been added to their pool; they have  to wait for the next chance to spend a Story Point.  Another limiter on Story Points is that you can only  spend one Story Point during a single action (unless an  ability specifies otherwise). If your character has multiple  ways to spend Story Points during an action, you’ll have  to think carefully about which of those ways provides  the best opportunity to spend that Story Point. Likewise,  your GM may only spend one Story Point per action.  In the following section, we explain some of the ways  in which Story Points can be used. Unless noted other -  wise in an option’s description, both the players and the  GM have access to that option.  a   h elpin G   h an D  All characters have the opportunity to call on destiny  to enhance any skill check they are about to attempt.  You may spend one Story Point to upgrade the abil -  ity of your character’s starting dice pool once. In other  words, you may upgrade one   󲊷   into the superior  󲊻 . Your GM may spend a Story Point in this way to  upgrade an NPC’s dice pool. Additional information  on upgrading dice can be found on page   22 .  r aisin G   the   s takes  Destiny can also be used to help keep characters out of  harm’s way. Players can call on fate and destiny to make  an opponent’s skill check more challenging. You may  spend one Story Point to upgrade the difficulty of any  NPC’s skill check once. This refers to upgrading a   󲊷  into the more potent   󲊻 . Your GM may spend a Story  Point in this way to upgrade difficulty in a PC’s dice  pool. Additional information on upgrading dice can be  found on page   22 .  s pecial   a bilities   an D   t alents  Many powerful talents allow your characters to spend  Story Points for various effects. See the individual tal -  ent descriptions for details, starting on page   72 .  l uck   an D   D   eus   e x   m achina  You can also use Story Points to introduce “facts” and  additional context directly into the narrative. Your GM  already does this by managing and directing the story,  but this use of Story Points provides you and your fellow  players with a means to make contributions as well.  Imagine that your characters (in a science fiction set -  ting) land on a planet they expected to have a breath -  able atmosphere, only to find that a leak at the gas  mining facility has rendered the air toxic. One of the  players suggests spending a Story Point, saying “Good  thing you remembered to pack those space suits last  time we were in dry dock!” While none of you may  have specifically mentioned or listed space suits before, Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 29  it’s a sensible and  creative addition to the game. If  your GM agrees, the Story Point is spent, and the play -  er’s suggestion becomes a true statement—there are  space suits handy in the hold of your characters’ ship.  Similarly, you may spend a Story Point in this man -  ner to suggest finding a spare first aid kit while quickly  scavenging through a medical facility, or to propose  introducing a terrain feature that your characters can  duck behind for cover.  Using Story Points narratively is a great way to keep  all of the players involved and the story moving for -  ward. However, your GM has final say over what is and  is not acceptable. You should not abuse this use of Story  Points; the more outrageous or unlikely the suggestion,  the more likely it is that your GM will curtail Story  Point use. Ultimately, narrative use of Story Points  allows you and your fellow players to feel empowered  as active participants in the game and story by reward -  ing their creativity and roleplaying. If a requested use  of a Story Point would contribute toward this goal,  your GM should consider allowing it.  s tory   p oint   e conomy   in   G ameplay  We encourage you and your GM to use Story Points  regularly, creating an ebb and flow of fate and fortune  over the course of a session. While you and your fellow  players could theo -  retically   “lock”   all   the  Story Points and simply not spend  any Story Points from the player pool to prevent  your GM from gaining any Story Points to use against  you, this works against both the spirit of the mechanics  and the setting. If your group hoards its Story Points,  you may find your GM using other methods of putting  pressure on the group, forcing you to reconsider your  plan. It’s perfectly acceptable for your GM to remind  you about using Story Points in play, such as by sug -  gesting the use of Story Points if they are feeling over -  matched by a tough enemy.  Story Points play an important role in making games  in   Genesys   seem more exciting and thrilling. When  used wisely, Story Points provide tension and excite -  ment by making routine checks more significant, add -  ing an element of drama to the mundane, or helping  provide a boost when your characters are overwhelmed.  t he   l imits   of   l uck  Story Points represent a powerful resource that must  be used wisely. Each player (you, your fellow players,  or the GM) can invest only one Story Point in any sin -  gle check. If a player chooses to invest a Story Point  to upgrade an   󲊷   into a   󲊻 , for example, that player  cannot also invest a Story Point to trigger one of their  character’s talents. The GM may also choose to invest  one Story Point per skill check. This does introduce the  possibility that both player and GM will invest a Story  Point in the same skill check, resulting in no net differ -  ence in the balance between the two story pools. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 30  The active player (the player or GM forming the dice  pool) always has the first chance to use a Story Point.  Once that player has decided whether or not to use a  Story Point, the other party involved in the check (the  targeted player, or the GM in the case of an NPC) has  the opportunity to respond and spend a Story Point as  well. For example, if the GM spends a Story Point to  upgrade an enemy’s Ability die   󲊷   into a Proficiency die  󲊻   for an attack against a PC, that PC’s player has the  opportunity to then use a Story Point, either to upgrade  one of the pool’s   󲊷   into a   󲊻 , or perhaps to trigger one  of the PC’s talents.  This order of activation (and the limit of one  Story Point per player) is important. First, we don’t  want people to spend an unlimited number of Story  Points, and without the limit of one Story Point per  player and not transferring points to the opposing  pool until after the situation is resolved, that’s exactly  what you would have. In addition, forcing the active  player to decide whether to spend a Story Point first  means that you avoid having the active player change  their mind and spend a Story Point after their oppo -  nent decides to spend one. In short, these keep the  game from bogging down.  e xperien C e   and   d evelop M ent  A s your characters play through their adventures,  they learn from their successes—and mistakes—  in order to better themselves in preparation for even  greater challenges. Experience represents the primary  means by which you customize your characters. Each  PC starts with a beginning pool of experience points  that can be spent during character creation to train  skills, improve characteristics, or acquire talents.  During each session of a   Genesys   game, your  player characters receive additional experience, which  can also be spent to improve their skills and purchase  talents. We talk about that more on page 129. How -  ever, our basic guidance is that each character should  earn roughly 20 experience points at the end of each  session. This allows you to buy an interesting advance -  ment for your character every session or two.  s tartin G   e xperience   p oints  Player characters begin with a number of   experience  points (XP) based on their species or archetype. The  experience points used during character creation are  the same “currency” as experience points received  during play. If you choose to spend fewer experience  points than budgeted during character creation, those  points carry over into the game, and your PC has  more experience points to spend once the adventures  begin. More information on spending starting expe -  rience points can be found in   Chapter 2: Creating  Characters , on page   32 .  i mprovin G   c haracteristics  Raising a characteristic during character creation costs  a number of XP equal to ten times the value of the next  highest rating. No characteristic can ever be increased  above 5. Characteristics may only be purchased with  experience points during character creation, not at any  later time. During gameplay, characteristics can only  be increased by acquiring specific high-tier talents. For  more on raising characteristics, see page   44 .  s kill   t rainin G  Each skill has five ranks of training available. A player  character may have already acquired a couple of ranks  of skill training from their starting career for free. PCs  may train additional skills and gain additional ranks  during character creation. Regardless of any species or  career bonuses, no skill can be raised higher than rank  2 during character creation.  Training a skill costs a number of XP equal to five  times the value of the next highest rank. You may pur -  chase ranks in skills for your PC during character cre -  ation or later during gameplay.  We should note that non-career skills (skills not listed  in your starting career) cost a bit more to advance.  In addition to the regular costs for buying a rank of a  non-career skill (five times the value of the next highest  rank), you must spend an additional 5 XP. See page   40  for more information about careers and career skills.  a c Q uirin G   t alents  Talents can be acquired by spending experience to  purchase them. The cost of the talent depends on  what tier that talent occupies. A talent costs five  times the value of the talent’s tier (so a Tier 1 tal -  ent costs 5 XP, and a Tier 2 talent costs 10 XP). We  have some other perquisites and rules that govern  purchasing talents, so we suggest checking out page  71   for more information. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

After you  determine this initial value, increases to Brawn rat -  ing after character creation do not increase your  character’s   wound   threshold;   wound   threshold  improvements can then be acquired only by pur -  chasing the appropriate talent, such as Toughened.  s train   t hreshol D  Your   character’s   strain   threshold   represents   how  much stress they can withstand before becoming  stunned, dazed, or otherwise incapacitated. Strain  represents psychological or mental damage to a char -  acter. Characters can suffer strain more easily than  wounds. Strain can even be used as a resource by  players to trigger certain character abilities. Thank -  fully, characters recover from strain more quickly  than from wounds.  Your character’s starting strain threshold is deter -  mined based upon species or archetype and Will -  power rating. After you determine this initial value,  increases to Willpower rating after character creation  do not increase your character’s strain threshold;  strain threshold improvements are then acquired only  by purchasing appropriate talents, such as Grit.  D efense  Defense   determines   how   difficult   your   character  is to hit in combat situations. Characters have both  a ranged defense and a melee   defense. A charac -  ter’s default value in both ranged defense and melee  defense is zero. If a character’s defense value is listed  simply as “Defense” and is not specifically defined  by separate ranged and melee values, then apply the  same value to both ranged and melee defense.  Defense is most commonly gained by wearing armor  or by adopting a defensive position in combat, such as  taking cover. Some talents may also increase one of a  character’s defense ratings.  s oak   v alue  Your character’s   soak value determines how much  incoming damage they can shrug off before taking  real harm. Subtract the soak value from any incoming  damage to the character. Any damage remaining after  subtracting the soak value becomes wounds applied  against the character’s wound threshold.  A character’s default soak value equals their Brawn  rating. After determining this initial value, increases  to Brawn rating do increase the character’s soak value.  Additional soak value bonuses are most often gained  by wearing armor. Some talents may also increase a  character’s innate soak value. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

CHAPTER 2: CREATING CHARACTERS  W hatever setting or type of roleplaying game you  play, you need to make a character to play in  it. Creating a character for   Genesys   takes a few short  steps, allowing you to get involved in the action right  away. To create a character, you need access to this rule -  book, a character sheet (found at the end of this book),  and a pencil. You also need access to ten-sided dice  (d10) for rolling on certain charts. Finally, a few sheets  of notepaper are not necessary but might be helpful.  Character generation uses a point-buy system, mean -  ing you have a budget of experience points you can  invest in different aspects of your character. Selecting  a character’s species or archetype determines the char -  acter’s starting characteristics and starting experience  points. After making that initial choice, you’ll invest  those experience points to improve starting character -  istics, acquire training in key skills, and  learn special talents.  c haracter   c oncept  The section that fol -  lows   provides   the  rules for creating  a character, both as they exist as a person, and as they  interact with the game mechanics. The central core of  the idea for your character, however, must come from  you. You need to start out with the seed of a concept for  a character that fits into the game you’re going to play.  At the earliest stages of character creation, you, your  fellow players, and your Game Master should have a  detailed discussion about the types of characters to cre -  ate. If your GM has a specific campaign framework in  mind, it could require the presence of specific types of  skills or even focus on a limited subset of species or  archetypes. A campaign that takes place exclusively in  a city might have less need for the Survival skill, while  one set in a war might focus more on combat skills than  on skills related to diplomacy. Sometimes your GM  might want to adjust the campaign based on the play -  ers’ wishes, and you’re likely to appreciate the opportu -  nity to tweak your initial character ideas. Information  shared at this stage can help you and your Game Mas -  ter work together to create characters that complement  the types of stories envisioned for the campaign.  While some character concepts can be a better fit  for a campaign, seldom is a concept truly wrong. Role -  playing games often work best when everyone willingly  works in a collaborative fashion.  Constructive criticism as well Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

as meaningful compromises during character creation  can lead to a more fulfilling gameplay experience. You  and your friends should be open to one another’s ideas  at this stage. Working together to bring out the most  fun and entertaining aspects of different characters can  be a great way for you to establish a rapport that lasts  throughout a campaign.  G eneration   s teps  To create a character, follow these six steps. Each step  is summarized here and then fully explained later in  the chapter.  s tep   1: D   etermine   b ack G roun D  Each character starts as an idea. Do you want to play a  noble knight working to save the poor and oppressed, a  secret agent skilled at infiltration, or a clever computer  hacker? What kind of character you make depends on  the type of game and the setting (you’re not likely to  make a medieval knight in a modern day setting, after  all!) So, before starting the game, you should take a few  minutes to think about the character you want to build  and what you want that character’s background to be.  Where did your character come from, and  what inspired them to leave their former  life and pursue a life of adventure?  More information on devel -  oping your character’s back -  ground begins on page   34 .  s tep   2:   s elect   a   c haracter   a rchetype   or   s pecies  The nature of this step depends a lot on the setting  chosen. In a typical fantasy setting, for example, you  may choose whether your character is a human, a  dwarf, an elf, or an orc. In a space opera setting, you  may choose to make your character one of any num -  ber of fantastical alien species. However, in the base  rule set, you choose between four different archetypes  of human: the laborer, the aristocrat, the intellectual,  and the average human.  Whether you’re choosing an archetype of human -  ity or an entirely different species, this choice estab -  lishes your character’s initial ratings in the character -  istics of Brawn, Agility, Intellect, Cunning, Willpower,  and Presence. This choice also determines secondary  characteristics, including wound and strain thresh -  olds. Finally, the choice you make here may also give  your character a unique intrinsic ability that would be  impossible to get elsewhere.  Needless to say, once you’ve chosen an   archetype,  species, or race for your character, that choice is per -  manent. Your character cannot suddenly change from  a human into an elf in the  middle of a game.  More on this step can be  found on page   35 . Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 34  s tep   3:   c hoose   a   c areer  Your character’s   career is both their narrative role  within the setting and their mechanical role within the  party. You choose one career for your character, and  you cannot switch careers later on in the game.  Careers don’t rigidly define what your character  does, however. They simply make it easier to advance  into some skills and harder to advance into others.  They also help define characters when they start out,  making starting characters more interesting to play.  More on this step can be found on page   40 .  s tep   4:   i nvest   e xperience   p oints  The species (or archetype, or race) you select for your  character establishes an initial pool of   experience  points (XP). You can spend these experience points to  improve certain aspects of the character: to increase  characteristics, purchase additional ranks in skills, or  acquire talents. You may spend your character’s experi -  ence points in any combination of these areas, meaning  that any two characters can end up very different from  one another.  During gameplay, your character earns additional  experience points based on their achievements and  successes. Those points can also be spent to purchase  new skill ranks and talents.  Information   about   spending   experience   points  begins on page   44 .  s tep   5: D   etermine   D   erive D   a ttributes  You should only perform this step after you’ve com -  pleted the previous steps, since several attributes can  only be determined after you’ve fully established your  character’s starting characteristics and talents. The  derived attributes include wound threshold, strain  threshold, defense, and soak value.  Full information on calculating these attribute values  can be found on page   45 .  s tep   6: D   etermine   m otivation  Your character’s   Motivation reflects their primary call to  take action and experience adventures. It represents the  driving force or forces in their life. In some instances,  a character’s primary Motivation depicts an overarch -  ing philosophical belief. Other characters focus on more  concrete objectives, often associated with the desire to  aid family or close allies. A few choose a specific goal  that they hope to achieve within their lifetime, possibly  moving on to another one should they ever do so.  Four facets define Motivation: Desire, Fear, Strength,  and Flaw. Each of these Motivations has a list of specific  manifestations. Of course, you can always make up a  unique Motivation for your character; the list we pro -  vided is meant more as a starting point than an exhaus -  tive set of options.  Motivation is important to your character’s progres -  sion. Playing to their Motivation can earn you addi -  tional XP at the end of a session. Motivations are also  very important to social encounters.  Different Motivations are presented on page   46 .  s tep   7:   c hoose   G   ear   ,   a ppearance   ,   an D   p ersonality  Once you’ve defined your character’s species or arche -  type, background, Motivation, and any other important  attributes, you begin determining their descriptive details.  Height, weight, eye color, hair color and style (or tentacle  or horn color), skin color, build, distinguishing features  such as scars and tattoos, and choice of clothing are all  descriptive details that can be determined narratively.  This information can and often should be linked to previ -  ous choices you made while building your PC; a character  with a high Brawn may be more muscular, for instance,  while a character raised in a desert may have skin that’s  been weathered and deepened by the punishing sun.  Each PC also starts the game with personal gear and  weaponry worth 500 currency. At this stage, the PC  may select this gear.  This step is presented on page   51 . More informa -  tion on equipment can be found on page   82 .  s tep   1:   d eter M ine   b a C kground  C oming up with your character’s   background is the  important first step in inventing and building your  character. However, it’s also the step with the fewest  rules. We figured this is actually appropriate. After all,  this is a roleplaying game, so inventing your character’s  history should be more of an exercise in narrative sto -  rytelling than an exercise in game mechanics. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 35  Nevertheless, we expect that your character’s back -  ground will inform how you build your character. For  example, if your character is a hard-working miner  from a frontier planet in a distant galaxy, you’ll prob -  ably want to build the character to be tough and strong,  and to have abilities appropriate for someone living on  a frontier world. Likewise, if your character is a schol -  arly sort from a prestigious university, you’ll probably  invest in making them smart and cultured.  The other thing about backgrounds is that they’re  going to be really dependent on the game setting. If  you’re playing in a medieval fantasy, your character  can’t be from an alien world. Conversely, if you’re play -  ing a game set in the distant future, your character  probably doesn’t come from a family of blacksmiths.  Now, keep in mind that your character’s game statis -  tics don’t all need to reflect their background. Instead,  the background is meant to provide depth to the char -  acter, offering insights on personality and mindset  that are not evident in skills, talents, and other abili -  ties. Knowing a character’s origin can often provide a  useful framework for determining what goals your PC  might have as well as the paths they might pursue to  achieve those goals.  With that in mind, we’ve prepared a short list of  questions. You don’t have to answer them (from a  rules perspective, your character doesn’t need to  have any background at all), or you can pick and  choose the ones you like. However, answering some  or all of them may help you as you invent your char -  acter’s background.  b ack G roun D   Q uestions  Where does your character come from? This can be spe -  cific to the setting (Planet Ebulon in the Delta Cluster) or  generic (a small farming town in the hills). But in either  case, where are your character’s roots, and what does  your character think about the place they grew up in?  Who is your character’s family? Did your character  grow up with a lot of siblings, or were they an only  child? Did they have parents? If so, who were they? If  not, who raised your character? Is your character still  on good terms with their family, or not?  What is your character’s social standing? Is your  character a respected member of their community and  culture? Or are they simply one of the unremarkable  masses? Or maybe they’re an outcast, shunned by the  members of “decent” society? What did your character  do before they became an adventurer?  How old is your character? Are they young and  brash, or old and wise? (Or maybe old and brash, or  young and wise.) If they’re middle-aged or older, how  have they changed as they’ve aged?  What does your character think about the world?  Your answer could be very general (a cynical attitude  toward everyone they meet), or specific to the setting  (they hate the unjust rule of the Federation of Sol). You  could even ask and answer this question multiple times,  picking a different aspect of the setting each time.  Why did your character leave home? Likely, your  character is now an adventurer and has left part or all of  their old life behind them. Why? What happened?  s tep   2:   s ele C t   a   C hara C ter   a r C hetype   or   s pe C ies  A s we mentioned in the summary on page   33 , the  exact nature of this choice depends on the game set -  ting. Many settings have fantastical elements, and one of  those elements is being able to play other species (we’re  using “species” as a catchall term to refer to all character  types when some of the options aren’t human). Tradi -  tional fantasy often has elves, dwarves, orcs, and the like,  while many science fiction settings have a plethora of  intelligent alien life forms.  However, we’ve built the core Narrative Dice System  with humans as your only default starting species (if  you want to explore non-human options more, check  out our example settings in   Part II ,   starting on page  136). To give you an interesting choice, and also flesh  out gameplay options for settings where other species  aren’t an option, we let you choose between four differ -  ent archetypes when building your character.  Mechanically,   archetypes and   species do the same  thing during character creation. Your choice among  archetypes and species establishes your character’s base  characteristics as well as your secondary attributes, such  as wound and strain thresholds. Once you’ve set the base -  line through your choice, then that choice also provides  a budget of experience points that you spend to improve  your characteristics and buy skills and talents. We’re  going to get into that more during   Step 3   (page   44 ).  So, right now, you need to choose one of the four  archetypes for your character (or if you’re going to select Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 36  a species, choose one instead of choosing an archetype).  Keep in mind, this choice is permanent. Your character  is not going to be able to adopt a new archetype or spe -  cies in the midst of a game; you’d just need to build a new  character at that point.  a rchetype   l ayout  We can break an archetype into several different parts  to make it easier to understand. The first part consists  of the starting characteristics for your character. It’s  important to note that these are starting characteris -  tics, so you’ll have the chance to improve them later on.  The second part consists of the derived attributes we  mentioned on page   31 . The two that are specifically  determined by archetype are your character’s wound  threshold and strain threshold.  The third part consists of your character’s starting expe -  rience points. Later on, during   Step 3 , you’ll be able to  spend those experience points to improve your character.  The fourth part consists of any special abilities that  your character starts with because of their archetype.  Some archetypes (or species) give your character a free  talent, free ranks in select skills, or unique abilities.  a rchetype   1:   a vera G e   h uman  The average human archetype is our baseline for char -  acter creation, and portrays the most customizable  example of a person. You should choose this archetype  if you prefer to play “generalist” characters, who are  never going to be terrible at anything. You should also  choose this archetype if you have a very specific type  of character in mind, since this archetype has the most  customization options of the four choices.  The characteristics all start at 2, meaning your character  is going to have a hard time increasing any one character -  istic to a 4 or 5, but also that your character isn’t going to  have any characteristic they are truly lacking in. Likewise,  the strain and wound thresholds start at the average 10.  Your character starts with more ranks in skills than  anyone else, again playing to the idea of being a gen -  eralist. Your archetype ability is also a generalist abil -  ity. Effectively, your group gains a Story Point to spend  whenever it needs it. And finally, your character starts  with the most experience of any of the four archetypes.  Just remember, character creation is your only chance  to spend XP on characteristics (otherwise, to increase a  characteristic you need to purchase the Dedication tal -  ent; see page   81 ). We recommend you spend most of  these XP on improving your characteristics, while saving  at most 25–35 experience for talents and skills.  a rchetype   a bilities  •  2   2   2   2   2   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Starting Wound Threshold:   10 + Brawn  •   Starting Strain Threshold:   10 + Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   110  •   Starting Skills:   An average human starts with one  rank in each of two different non-career skills at  character creation. They obtain this rank before  spending experience points, and these skills may  not be increased higher than rank 2 during char -  acter creation.  •   Ready for Anything:   Once  per session as an out-of-turn  incidental, you may move one  Story Point from the Game  Master’s pool to the play -  ers’ pool. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 37  a rchetype   2:   t he   l aborer  The laborer archetype represents a character who has  a background in some form of manual labor, and who  is generally strong and tough. You should choose this  archetype if you’re planning on making a character  who focuses on fighting, especially fighting in melee  combat. You should also choose this archetype if your  character has a background of manual labor and hard  work.  This archetype starts with the Brawn characteris -  tic at 3 and the Willpower characteristic at 1. You’re  starting with a character who has better than average  Brawn (which makes it easier to improve Brawn fur -  ther), with the trade-off that your character has a worse  than average Willpower. You’ll have to either spend  valuable experience points buying that back to 2, or be  satisfied with this drawback. Likewise, your character’s  wound threshold is higher than average, but your strain  threshold is lower than average.  Finally, this archetype gets a special ability that lets  you turn a single Critical Injury result that your char -  acter suffers into the mildest Critical possible. Not only  does this protect your character from some debilitating  Crit results, but since the only way to permanently die  in our game is through some Critical effects, this can  even save your character from certain death.  a rchetype   a bilities  •  3   2   2   2   1   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Starting Wound Threshold:   12 + Brawn  •   Starting Strain Threshold:   8 + Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   100  •   Starting Skills:   A laborer starts with one rank in  Athletics during character creation. They obtain  this rank before spending experience points, and  may not increase Athletics above rank 2 during  character creation.  •   Tough as Nails:   Once per session, your character  may spend a Story Point as an out-of-turn inciden -  tal immediately after suffering a Critical Injury and  determining the result. If they do so, they count  the result rolled as “01.” Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 38  a rchetype   3:   t he   i ntellectual  The intellectual archetype represents a character who  has a background grounded in some sort of intellectual  pursuit. This pursuit could be science, medicine, teach -  ing, or even magic. You should choose this archetype  if you want to make a character who focuses on one  of those intellectual pursuits. You should also choose  this archetype if your character comes from a highly  educated background.  This archetype starts with the Intellect characteristic  at 3 and the Agility characteristic at 1. You’re starting  a character with a better than average Intellect (which  makes this characteristic easy to improve further) and  good strain threshold, but on the other hand, your  character has a worse than average Agility (and is going  to have a problem being effective in ranged combat).  You also have a worse than average wound threshold.  This archetype makes up for that, however, with a  pretty good ability. Their special ability lets your char -  acter count their ranks in a skill as equal to their Intel -  lect, and while it only works once per session, it can  mean the difference between success and failure on a  critical check.  a rchetype   a bilities  •  2   1   3   2   2   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Starting Wound Threshold:   8 + Brawn  •   Starting Strain Threshold:   12 + Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   100  •   Starting Skills:   An intellectual starts with one  rank   in   Knowledge   during   character   creation.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 39  a rchetype   4:   t he   a ristocrat  The aristocrat archetype represents any character who  has the gift of a silver tongue. This could be a noble of  some sort, a politician, a bard, or even a salesperson or  merchant. You should use this archetype if you want  to build a character who fits one of these molds. You  should also choose this archetype if your character is  good at communicating.  This archetype starts with the Presence characteris -  tic at 3 and the Brawn characteristic at 1. Unsurpris -  ingly, this means you’re starting with a character who  already has a good Presence, and whose Presence can  be improved easily. However, the low Brawn (and thus  low wound threshold and soak) means your character  won’t be much of a combatant without a major invest -  ment in experience points. You also have an average  starting wound and strain threshold.  Your character’s starting ability is good on its own,  but it can be paired with a number of talents or social  encounter actions for some really powerful effects.  Coupled with the archetype’s starting characteristics,  this archetype is perfect for characters who want to  dominate social situations (even if they’re not very  good at fighting)!  a rchetype   a bilities  •  1   2   2   2   2   3  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Starting Wound Threshold:   10 + Brawn  •   Starting Strain Threshold:   10 + Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   100  •   Starting Skills:   An aristocrat starts with one rank  in Cool during character creation. They obtain this  rank before spending experience points, and may  not increase Cool above rank 2 during character  creation.  •   Forceful Personality:   Once per session, your char -  acter may spend a Story Point as an incidental.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 40  s tep   3: C hoose   a   C areer  O ur character creation system mostly lets you build  your characters free-form, and it lets you define  your characters’ roles in the game by the choices you  make. However, many players prefer a little structure and  definition for their characters. For that, we have careers.  You can think of a career as your character’s job or  role. It’s a broad concept of what your character is going  to be especially good at during the game. Careers enable  your character to focus on being better at certain tasks  at the expense of others. A career is usually defined by  the role the character plays in the game, although we  do have some careers that may be thematically linked  to some element of your game’s setting.  Meanwhile, let’s move on to choosing your charac -  ter’s career. To do that, we need to go into a bit more  detail about what you’re choosing.  W hat   Does   t his   D o ?  Careers do two things for characters. First, they let the  characters count eight skills as career skills. This means  that all other skills are non-career skills for your char -  acter. Secondly, they let your character start the game  with four ranks in four separate career skills of your  choosing, representing your character’s greater training  and focus in matters concerning their career.  c areer   s kills   an D   n on   - c areer   s kills  Career and non-career skills are simply designations that  let us delineate some skills as easier (less expensive) for  your character to buy and some as harder (more expen -  sive) to buy. We’re going to explain how to use experience  points to purchase skills in a lot more detail during   Step 4 ,  on page   44 , where you spend your character’s starting  XP. For now, we’ll give you a very brief overview.  When you purchase a rank in a non-career skill, it  always costs five more XP than it would cost to buy the  same rank in a career skill. This means that while every  character has access to every skill, characters can level  up certain skills faster than others. This encourages you  and your fellow players to focus on your characters’  suite of career skills, and to only purchase non-career  skills if you really feel that your characters need them.  s tartin G   W ith   r anks   in   c areer   s kills  Not only are career skills cheaper for your character  to purchase, but they also let your character start with  some ranks in them. We did this to guarantee that your  starting character has training in a few skills when the  game begins. Plus, it helps direct your character toward  the career focus you chose.  After you select a career, choose four of its eight  career skills. Your character starts the game with one  rank in each of those four skills, without spending XP.  c areers  Now that you know what careers do, you’re going to  select one career for your character. This is the only  time you choose a career for your character, and once  you make this choice, the choice is permanent. There’s  no way to switch careers partway through the game.  However, this isn’t all that big a deal. After all, careers  just make it cheaper to purchase certain skills, but they  don’t stop you from buying others. If you find yourself  wanting your character to have a few ranks in a non-  career skill, go ahead and buy them!  r ole - b ase D   c areers  These careers are based on roles characters play in a party.  They are completely setting agnostic, so you can use them  in any game you run. This also means the careers don’t  have any setting-specific skills, although in some cases,  we do call out alternate skills that, if available in your set -  ting, you should use instead of a listed career skill.  e ntertainer  For the Entertainer, the whole world really is a stage.  Whatever their chosen medium, these artists, actors,  and musicians make their living brightening the days  of others. However, there can be a lot more to these  individuals than meets the eye, as some Entertainers  use their acting skills to cover more serious agendas.  The Entertainer counts the following skills as career  skills:   Charm ,   Coordination ,   Deception ,   Discipline ,  Leadership ,   Melee ,   Skulduggery , and   Stealth . Before  spending experience during character creation, an  Entertainer may choose four of their career skills and  gain one rank in each of them.  (If you are playing in a setting where this skill is avail -  able, switch   Melee   for   Melee [Light] , since most Enter -  tainers don’t carry around greataxes or greatswords, but  may prefer a rapier or other light blade.)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 41  e xplorer  The   Explorer is at home in the wild, able to handle any -  thing the wilderness throws at them. Explorers tend to  excel at surviving in the wilderness, and they often are  pretty good with ranged weapons. Explorers may be  military scouts, gruff and unsociable hunters, or people  who just prefer living in the wild.  The Explorer counts the following skills as career  skills:   Athletics ,   Brawl ,   Coordination ,   Deception ,  Perception ,   Ranged ,   Stealth , and   Survival . Before  spending experience during character creation, an  Explorer may choose four of their career skills and gain  one rank in each of them.

Healers are  good at keeping cool under pressure, maintaining focus,  and—of course—healing. However, these aren’t their  only capabilities. Depending on their background and  personality, Healers can also be good negotiators, tough  and durable medics, or even morally depraved surgeons  with a penchant for experimenting on their patients.  The Healer counts the following skills as career skills:  Cool ,   Discipline ,   Knowledge ,   Medicine ,   Melee ,   Resil -  ience ,   Survival , and   Vigilance .

Leaders have a knack for  taking charge and overseeing a situation, but their meth -  ods of leadership can vary wildly. A Leader can be a kind  and caring boss, a soft-spoken politician, or a military  commander who believes in absolute discipline.  The Leader counts the following skills as career skills:  Charm ,   Coercion ,   Cool ,   Discipline ,   Leadership ,  Melee ,   Negotiation , and   Perception .

Whether  swindling, burgling, or running a complicated con, the  Scoundrel has the skills needed to separate marks from  their money and valuables. A Scoundrel could be a cat  burglar, con artist, or quick-draw specialist, or just a  smooth-talking person who cheats at cards.  The Scoundrel counts the following skills as career  skills:   Charm ,   Cool ,   Coordination ,   Deception ,  Ranged ,   Skulduggery ,   Stealth , and   Streetwise . Before  spending   experience   during   character   creation,   a  Scoundrel may choose four of their career skills and  gain one rank in each of them.  (If you’re playing where this skill is available, switch  Ranged   for   Ranged [Light]   to better represent a Scoun -  drel’s preference for pistols and thrown weapons.)  s ocialite  Socialites are the consummate social butterflies, at ease  in any interactions involving talking to someone else.  Whether a rich debutante in the highest circles of soci -  ety or a good-natured bartender who knows everyone’s  name, a   Socialite can get along with anyone and every -  one. More importantly, they always know how to get  the best out of any social interaction.  The Socialite counts the following skills as career  skills:   Charm ,   Cool ,   Deception ,   Knowledge ,   Nego -  tiation ,   Perception ,   Streetwise , and   Vigilance . Before  spending   experience   during   character   creation,   a  Socialite may choose four of their career skills and gain  one rank in each of them.  s ol D ier  Soldiers are warriors through and through. At home on  the battlefield, they know everything there is to know  about surviving the horrors of combat—and making  sure the opposition doesn’t. Whether your Soldier is a  tough legionnaire armed with spear and shield, a mod -  ern soldier with an assault rifle and body armor, or a  futuristic marine carrying a laser cannon depends on  your setting. However, the basics of a career member of  the military never really change.

Soldiers  tend to wield larger weapons, whether those be spears,  pikes, muskets, or assault rifles. In addition, the more  futuristic the setting, the more likely the Soldier is to be  trained in heavy weapons as opposed to fistfighting.)  t ra D esperson  A   Tradesperson can be anyone who has skills in a job  that requires special training and some manual labor.  The form this career takes depends a lot on the setting.  Your Tradesperson could be a medieval blacksmith,  modern auto mechanic, futuristic computer customizer,  or chief engineer aboard a starship. They could also be a  no-nonsense worker who has no time for anything but  the job at hand, or a creative craftsperson who delights in  building something innovative.  The Tradesperson counts the following skills as  career skills:   Athletics ,   Brawl ,   Discipline ,   Mechanics ,  Negotiation ,   Perception ,   Resilience , and   Streetwise .  Before spending experience during character creation,  a Tradesperson may choose four of their career skills  and gain one rank in each of them.  s ettin G - b ase D   c areers  We’ve designed setting-based careers to still fit a role or  job for your character, but one that may only be appro -  priate to certain settings. After each career, we mention  which settings it is appropriate for. Needless to say, check  with your GM before you select one of these careers!  h acker   ( s cience   f iction   ,   s pace   o pera   ,   a ny   s ettin G  u sin G   the   h ackin G   a lternate   r ules   )  When we say   Hacker, we’re talking about the type of  computer operator who can do things with computers  that are well beyond modern reality. Hackers are a staple  of futuristic settings, where they can use their unparal -  leled affinity for computers to gain access to remote serv -  ers, control and override robotic drones, and engage in  virtual duels on the Internet or its equivalent.  The Hacker counts the following skills as career  skills:   Computers ,   Discipline ,   Knowledge ,   Mechan -  ics ,   Perception ,   Piloting ,   Streetwise , and   Vigilance .  Before spending experience during character creation,  a Hacker may choose four of their career skills and gain  one rank in each of them.  Hackers are most common in futuristic settings,  where computer capabilities are much more advanced.  However, you could have a Hacker in a modern setting  as well. It’s up to you and your GM whether you want  to handle computers more realistically, or the way com -  puter systems get portrayed in the movies!  f i G hter   p ilot   (W eir D   W ar ,   m o D ern ,   s cience   f iction ,   s pace  o pera ,   a ny   s ettin G   u sin G   v ehicle   a lternate   r ules )  Though what a   Fighter Pilot flies changes a lot depend -  ing on the setting, the Fighter Pilot career stays roughly  similar. Whether they’re flying a prop-driven fighter  plane, modern jet fighter, or futuristic starfighter, your  Fighter Pilot is probably a cool, cocky, and confident  individual with lightning-fast reflexes.  The Fighter Pilot counts the following skills as career  skills:   Cool ,   Driving ,   Gunnery ,   Mechanics ,   Percep -  tion ,   Piloting ,   Ranged (Light) , and   Vigilance . Before  spending   experience   during   character   creation,   a  Fighter Pilot may choose four of their career skills and  gain one rank in each of them.  A Fighter Pilot’s skill set fits into all of the recommended  settings, so there shouldn’t be any problems using these  skills. However, if you want to play this career, you’ll prob -  ably want to use the optional vehicle rules on page   220 .  k ni G ht   ( f antasy   )  The   Knight is a warrior of the nobility. A Knight’s title  comes with privilege, lands, and wealth, but also a  responsibility to defend their liege lord and the common  people who rely on the Knight for protection. Knights  often train for war from childhood, and they equip  themselves with the best arms and armor available.  The Knight counts the following skills as career skills:  Athletics ,   Discipline ,   Leadership ,   Melee (Heavy) ,  Melee (Light) ,   Resilience ,   Riding , and   Vigilance .  Before spending experience during character creation,  a Knight may choose four of their career skills and gain  one rank in each of them.  The Knight makes the most sense in a fantasy or  medieval setting. However, we could see Knights in  other settings that focus on the fantastical and whimsi -  cal, especially the steampunk and space opera settings.  These Knights may ride to battle aboard steam-powered  jet packs or a mechanoid battle-walker, but their focus is  still on riding into combat. If you use this career in a more  futuristic setting, you should switch   Melee (Heavy)   for  the broader   Melee   skill, and   Melee (Light)   for   Gunnery  (their mechanical conveyance may have heavy weapons  incorporated). You should also switch   Riding   for   Driv -  ing ,   Piloting , or   Operating   as appropriate. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Mad Scientists could be arcane researchers trying to  fuse magic and technology or brilliant inventors craft -  ing terrifying new mechanical creations. They don’t  have to be truly evil or even amoral, but generally Mad  Scientists are a little myopic. They get so focused on  their grand goals that they ignore the consequences of  their actions.  The Mad Scientist counts the following skills as career  skills:   Alchemy ,   Coercion ,   Knowledge ,   Mechan -  ics ,   Medicine ,   Operating ,   Skulduggery , and   Ranged  (Heavy) .   Before spending experience during charac -  ter creation, a Mad Scientist may choose four of their  career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

We represent those  results with the magic alternate rules (page   210 ), so  you should only use the   Priest career when you’re play -  ing in a game with magic. Whether a soft-spoken priest  who channels divine energy to heal the wounded, or a  raging battle-priest who smites enemies with a mace as  often as with holy wrath, a Priest is a devout believer in  something greater than themself.  The Priest counts the following skills as career skills:  Charm ,   Coercion ,   Cool ,   Discipline ,   Divine ,   Medicine ,  Melee , and   Negotiation . Before spending experience  during character creation, a Priest may choose four of  their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

Starship Captains are equally adept at repair -  ing, programming, and piloting a starship, but their  primary responsibility is leading and directing the crew  under their command.  The Starship Captain counts the following skills  as career skills:   Computers ,   Discipline ,   Gunnery ,  Knowledge ,   Leadership ,   Mechanics ,   Operating , and  Perception . Before spending experience during char -  acter creation, a Starship Captain may choose four of  their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.  As with Fighter Pilots, if you want to play a Starship  Captain, you should probably make sure your game  uses the vehicle alternate rules on page   220 . In addi -  tion, if you’re using this career in a space opera setting,  you should switch   Knowledge   for   Astrocartography ,  as this more accurately represents a Starship Captain’s  knowledge   specialization.   You   could   also   use   this  career for a Ship or Airship Captain in other settings.

Rituals,  cantrips, and chanted spells are all means by which the  Wizard channels arcane energies.  The Wizard counts the following skills as career  skills:   Arcana ,   Coercion ,   Discipline ,   Knowledge ,  Leadership ,   Skulduggery ,   Stealth ,   and   Vigilance .  Before spending experience during character creation,  a Wizard may choose four of their career skills and gain  one rank in each of them.  The Wizard can fit into any setting that you include  magic in, and that can be nearly any setting (even if  some settings, such as weird war, fantasy, and steam -  punk, make more sense than hard sci-fi). If you’re using  this career in a fantasy setting, you should switch   Stealth  for   Alchemy , just because between the two of them, we  feel Alchemy is more appropriate for the career.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 44  s tep   4:   i nvest   e xperien C e   p oints  I n   Step 2 , your character got a budget of experience  points based on the archetype or species you chose.  Now it’s time to spend those experience points (or, as we  often call them, “XP”). This section covers both how you  spend XP during character creation, and also how you’ll  spend the XP your character earns later during gameplay  (see   page 125   for earning XP during gameplay).  s tartin G   xp  Experience points are what you use to customize your  character and make them truly unique. During this step,  you can spend all of your character’s experience points on  improving characteristics, purchasing talents, and buying  ranks in skills. If you don’t spend all of your character’s  experience, that’s fine; you’ll save all the unspent experi -  ence points and can spend them at the end of any session  during the game. However, keep in mind that your char -  acter is going to be earning more experience points during  the course of their adventures, so you’ll have more experi -  ence to spend in the future. You may as well spend it now!  You may spend experience points in the following ways  to improve your character. These are also detailed in   Table  I.2–1: Spending Starting Experience   on page   45 .  i mprovin G   c haracteristics  During character creation, raising a characteristic to  the next highest rating costs ten times the value it is  being raised to. For example, raising your character’s  Brawn from 3 to 4 would require 40 experience points.  You must purchase each improvement sequentially.  This means that raising your character’s Brawn from 3  to 5 would cost 90 experience points: 40 for raising it  from 3 to 4, then 50 more for raising it from 4 to 5.  No characteristic can be increased higher than 5,  either in character creation or in gameplay.   How -  ever, this limit only applies to player characters (your  character). Non-player characters (also referred to as  adversaries) can have characteristics higher than 5. In  addition, any character may get access to equipment or  special powers that temporarily raise one or more of  their characteristics higher than 5. However, your char -  acter’s base characteristics still max out at 5.  Characteristics may only be purchased with experi -  ence points during character creation, not at any later  time. During gameplay, however, characteristics can be  increased by purchasing specific talents. This means you  should plan on spending most (if not all) of your start -  ing XP on improving your character’s characteristics.  s kill   t rainin G  The various skills your character can purchase depend  on what setting you’re playing in.   Chapter 3: Skills , on  page   52 , lists both general skills that apply to all set -  tings, and some setting-specific skills. So, when build -  ing your character, knows which skills will be in play.  Each skill has five ranks of training available. Your  character already has ranks in various skills. At this  stage, your character may purchase more ranks in skills  using their starting XP. However, regardless of any char -  acter creation options,   your character cannot have any  skills higher than rank 2 once character creation is  finished , unless a rule specifically states otherwise.  Buying a rank in a career skill follows a cost structure  similar to that for buying a rating in a characteristic;  training a skill to the next highest rank costs five times  the rank to which it is being raised. For example, train -  ing a skill from rank 0 (untrained) to rank 1 requires 5  experience points. Improving a rank 1 skill to rank 2  requires 10 experience points. Each rank must be pur -  chased sequentially. This means that acquiring a rank 2  career skill during character creation costs 15 experi -  ence points (5 for raising it from zero to rank 1, then 10  more for raising it from rank 1 to rank 2).  Buying a rank in a non-career skill works mostly the  same way, but costs a bit more. Each rank of a non-  career skill costs five times the rank you’re purchas -  ing, plus 5 additional experience points. So, raising a  non-career skill to rank 1 costs 10 XP, while raising  it from rank 1 to rank 2 costs 15 XP. As with career  skills, each rank must be purchased sequentially.  You may purchase ranks in skills for your character  during character creation or later during gameplay.  e xperien C ed   C hara C ters  Our character creation rules focus on creating  new adventurers. However, you may want to start  with characters who are a bit more experienced.  In this case, you can give your characters some  additional XP to spend after character creation.  We recommend an additional 50 XP. This can -  not be spend on characteristics, just skills and  talents. In addition, this XP cannot be used to  increase a skill above rank 3. This should make  your characters feel more capable but still give  them room to improve throughout the game. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 45  You probably want to buy a couple of ranks of vari -  ous skills now, but you can spend most of your XP on  characteristics and wait to buy more skills with the XP  your character earns as the game progresses.  a c Q uirin G   t alents  Talents are something any character can purchase. Like  skills, the talents available to your character depend on  what setting you’re playing in.   Chapter 4: Talents , on  page   71 , lists the talents available in all settings and  some specific to individual settings. So, as with skills,  before you build your character, make sure your GM  has decided on a setting and what talents to allow.  Purchasing talents is covered in greater detail on page  71 . However, here is a brief summary. Talents are  organized into tiers, with each talent costing five XP  times its tier level. So, Tier 1 talents cost 5 XP, but Tier 5  talents cost 25 XP. You can buy as many Tier 1 talents for  your character as you like, but if you want to purchase  talents in higher tiers, you have to follow this simple rule:  after buying a talent in a tier, you must ensure your  character has more talents in the tier directly below it.  Characters may purchase talents during character  creation or later during gameplay. Even more so than  with skills, you probably want to spend sparingly on  talents during character creation. You’ll have plenty of  chances to buy talents once the game begins.  s tep   5:   d eter M ine   d erived   a ttributes  O nce you’ve spent your character’s starting XP, the  next step is to determine your character’s derived  attributes. We call them derived attributes because they  are determined by your character’s other attributes and  your choice of archetype or species.  W oun D   t hreshol D  Your character’s wound threshold represents, basically,  how many wounds—how much physical damage—a  character can withstand before becoming incapacitated.  Your character’s starting wound threshold is determined  by adding the wound threshold for their archetype or  species to their Brawn rating (after spending starting XP).  After you determine this initial value, further increases  to your character’s Brawn rating do not increase their  wound threshold—wound threshold improvements are  acquired by purchasing talents, such as Toughened.  Our system assumes that a starting character with a  wound threshold of 15–18 is pretty tough and able to  suffer several hits without being incapacitated. A wound  threshold of 11–14 is about average; your character can  take a hit or two before going down. A wound threshold  of 10 or lower means your character may be incapacitated  by one powerful hit, and should be careful in combat.  s train   t hreshol D  Your character’s   strain threshold determines how much  strain—psychological and mental damage—a charac -  ter can withstand before becoming stunned, dazed, or  incapacitated. Your character’s starting strain threshold  is determined by adding the strain threshold for their  archetype or species to their Willpower rating (after  spending starting XP). After you determine this initial  value, further increases to your character’s Willpower  rating do not increase their strain threshold—strain  threshold improvements are acquired by purchasing  appropriate talents, such as Grit.  Our system assumes that a starting character with  a strain threshold of 13–16 is going to be generally  unconcerned   with   accumulating   strain,   except   in  TABLE I.2–1: SPENDING STARTING EXPERIENCE  Options   Cost   Character Creation Limits  May spend experience to increase characteristics.

A strain threshold  of 10–12 is about average; you should keep an eye on  the strain your character suffers but not worry about  it too much. However, a strain threshold of 9 or lower  means that strain is your character’s weakness. If you’re  not careful, your character could be incapacitated by  accumulating too much of it.  D efense  Defense represents an extra level of protection that  makes your character harder to hit in combat. Defense  is divided into ranged defense and melee defense. Your  character’s default value for each defense rating is 0.  Defense is most commonly gained by wearing armor  or by adopting a defensive position in combat (such as  gaining cover). Some talents may also increase one or  both of your character’s defense ratings.  Besides using certain types of gear, there is no easy  way for your character to have a starting melee or ranged  defense higher than 0. So, if your character doesn’t have  any   defense, don’t worry! You didn’t do anything wrong.  Your character has another type of protection, called soak.  s oak   v alue  Soak value determines how much damage a charac -  ter can shrug off every time they’re hit. When your  character   suffers   damage   (usually   from   someone  attacking them), you subtract your character’s soak  value from the damage inflicted. Any remaining dam -  age after subtracting soak becomes wounds, which you  apply against your character’s wound threshold.  Just a note: sometimes damage becomes strain instead,  and is applied against your character’s strain threshold  instead of wound threshold. This comes from certain  weapons or attacks, and we’ll explain it more later.  Your character’s default soak value is equal to their  Brawn rating. After you determine this initial value,  subsequent increases to a character’s Brawn rating do  increase their soak value. You can also increase your  character’s soak by buying armor for that character.  Some talents, such as Enduring, increase a character’s  innate soak value as well.  Our system considers a starting   soak value of 5 or  higher to be better than average; your character reduces a  significant amount of damage from each attack, which is  going to help them survive many more hits. A soak value  of 3–4 is average, which is fine. Without a significant  investment of resources, your character can still reduce  damage sufficiently to be effective in combat. If your  character has a soak value of 1–2, however, you’ll have  to play it smart in combat situations. You’ll want to try  to take enemies by surprise, fight from cover (or a hid -  den position), or attack them from a long distance away.  Basically, you’ll want to avoid being hit in the first place.  s tep   6:   d eter M ine   C hara C ter   M otivation  J ust as important as a character’s physical characteris -  tics are their emotions, beliefs, and faults. Skills and  characteristics display the character’s aptitude, but the  character’s Motivations determine when they use those  skills and why. The Game Master has dominion over the  external journeys of the player characters—where they  go, what adversaries they face, and which quests they  must complete—but you largely get to determine your  character’s psyche and social disposition. Characters  with identical species and career choices might feel com -  pletely dissimilar due to different Motivations.  Motivation   includes   a   character’s   driving   forces:  what ultimate goal is your character pursuing? What  are they most afraid of? What character trait allows  them to persevere in the face of adversity? What flaws  hinder their ability to pursue their goals?  Desires, Fears, Strengths, Flaws: these four different  facets of Motivation color how your character perceives  and interacts with the world. In other words, these  facets affect how you, the player, roleplays the charac -  ter. The four facets of Motivation can also be leveraged  by others when attempting to persuade, coerce, or oth -  erwise influence the character during social encoun -  ters. Finally, a Game Master interested in a more char -  acter-focused game can look to the player characters’  Motivations to craft compelling campaigns that include  inner emotional arcs for the characters in addition to  their physical journeys.  In the following sections, you have the chance to  select or roll randomly for a Desire, Fear, Strength, and  Flaw. If you do not care for the sample motivational  facets, feel free to craft motivational facets uniquely  suited to your character with the help of the Game  Master. Whichever route you choose, you should focus  on linking your character’s archetype or species, career,  talents, and background together with Motivation to  create a detailed persona.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 47  D esire  The Desire aspect of your character tracks most closely  with what we typically think of when we hear the term  “motivation”: it’s the reason why the character acts.  What, more than anything else, does your character  want or want to achieve? This is the most important  element of your character in a character-driven cam -  paign, because it is how you signal to the GM the types  of challenges you want your character to face. Desire is  still important in a plot-driven campaign, as it flavors  the way your character approaches the story.  Desire represents the thing your character wants,  although they might not know what that is just yet. It  provides a roleplaying touchstone for your character to  help you answer the question “What would my char -  acter do?” When your character wants something, it’s  easier for them to pursue it because they’re driven—  because they’re excited and enthusiastic.  Your character’s Desire need not be a noble or  altruistic goal. However, as with the other facets of  your character’s Motivation, you should discuss your  choices with the GM. Having a negative or evil Desire,  such as one that is in conflict with the Motivations of  the other PCs or the rest of society, may disrupt the  party dynamics or the course of the adventure.  If you do not already have a Desire in mind for  your character, you may roll on   Table I.2–2: Example  Desires   to determine one randomly. After rolling, you  should work with the GM to come up with specif -  ics surrounding the Desire. Characters typically have  one Desire, but players who want a roleplaying-heavy  campaign may opt to develop a secondary Desire as  well, potentially one that is in conflict with the pri -  mary Desire. At some point, the character may have to  choose between one and the other, making for a mem -  orable character moment.  Alternatively, you may decide to keep a character’s  true Desire a secret, picking a false Desire as a “front”  to mislead the other player characters. Again, this  should be done in consultation with the GM.  TABLE I.2–2: EXAMPLE DESIRES  d100 Dice Roll   Result  01–10   Ambition:   Your character craves power and authority over others. The character may pursue privilege, social status, or rank to  achieve this goal.  11–20   Belonging:   Your character seeks to be liked by others and goes out of the way to make a good impression. Your character seeks  to be accepted by a community or faction.  21–30   Expertise:   Your character wants to excel in a chosen field or skill. To achieve perfection, your character practices constantly.  31–40   Fame:   Your character seeks the limelight and wants to be famous. They pursue anything that can garner attention and praise.  41–50   Justice:   Your character believes in a set of ethics that demands fair treatment for all. Your character is dedicated to righting  inequality and protecting others’ rights.  51–60   Knowledge:   Your character wishes to uncover knowledge that may have been lost, forgotten, or locked away. This information  could pertain to the world, or it could pertain to your character’s past or origins.  61–70   Love:   Your character seeks romantic affection and intimacy from another character. Your character might already have a true  love or may strive to find someone to love and be loved by.  71–80   Safety:   Your character values peace and comfort above all else. Perhaps they seek shelter, a steady source of food, or other  material necessities, or they might seek emotional security in a place free from oppression and abuse.  81–90   Vengeance:   Someone or something wronged your character in the past, and the character has sworn to exact revenge against  the aggrieving party.  91–00   Wealth:   Money or material possessions are the prime goal for your character. Your character may be active in business, trade,  or the tried-and-true method of theft to increase their net worth. EXAMPLE: DESIRE  For example, Katrina rolls on the chart and deter -  mines that her renegade clone character, Akiko,  seeks knowledge. Part of Akiko’s character con -  cept is that she possesses minor psychic powers,  something that can’t be explained by the scientific  understanding of the setting. Katrina decides that  the circumstances of Akiko’s creation could be  mysterious, so Akiko wants to know who created  her and for what purpose. Katrina can’t wait to see  to what lengths Akiko goes to find this informa -  tion during play! Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 48  f ear  A character’s Fear represents the thing they dread. It  might be the character’s deepest insecurity, their bogey -  man, or a deep-seated threat to their culture or life.  Acting against a character’s fears and overcoming  them makes for challenging encounters and rewarding  moments of roleplaying. As we’ve seen time and again  in storytelling, fear can be leveraged against individuals  to make them do terrible things or force them to give  up on their desires entirely. Your character may suc -  cumb by avoiding the thing they fear, refusing to risk  confronting their Fear in order to obtain their desires,  or doing something terrible because the object of their  Fear forces them to.  Playing to your character’s Fear can be a bit difficult,  but also very enjoyable. While many of us don’t like our  characters to appear weak or to fail, you should think  of your character as the protagonist of a story or a film.  Some of the best character arcs come when characters  are defeated by their fears early on in a story, only to  fight through them at the narrative’s climax.  For that reason, having your character succumb to  their Fear and having your character overcome their  Fear are both great ways to use this Motivation. Just  make sure you do a bit of both. Having your character  continually fail can be disappointing for everyone, but  having them invariably succeed removes any amount  of realism or risk from your character’s story.  If you do not already have a Fear in mind, you may  roll on   Table I.2–3: Example Fears   to determine one  randomly. After rolling, you should work with the GM  to come up with specifics surrounding the Fear.  s tren G th  Your character’s Strength is one of the best things  about them. It’s the first thing you’d put on your char -  acter’s résumé, the one word other people use when  praising your character, and the defining feature that  they’re known for.  A Strength is usually a personality trait, a mental  quirk your character possesses that sets them apart.  Being rich, athletic, or attractive are all certainly  bonuses for a person, but they’re not what we’re  TABLE I.2–3: EXAMPLE FEARS  d100 Dice Roll   Result  01–10   Change:   Your character finds routine and stability comforting, and fears changes that could upend their day-to-day routine.  11–20   Commitment:   The idea of making promises or being relied on scares your character, who hates the idea that someone else is  relying on them. This fear of commitment could manifest in relationships, on the job, or among family.  21–30   Death:   The fear of death is deep and primal, and it drives a lot of our behaviors. There are a large number of ways this could  manifest in your character, many of them similar to what you see in real life.  31–40   Expression:   Your character has some behavior or means of expressing themself privately that they do not want the world to  know about. The nature of that behavior is up to you. Keep the setting in mind when you come up with it, though.  41–50   Failure:   Most people dislike failure, but some actively fear it. That fear may drive them to try to become absolutely perfect, or  it may crush them into inaction. Maybe it does both.  51–60  Humiliation:   Characters who are especially concerned with how others view them are particularly sensitive to potential  humiliation. They go out of their way to avoid ever appearing wrong or foolish, even if that means missing out on exciting  opportunities and experiences.  61–70   Isolation:   Your character fears being isolated from other people and being doomed to live and die alone. Maybe this drives  them to seek out relationships with anyone and everyone, even when a relationship is unpleasant or unhealthy.  71–80   Nemesis:   Your character has a deadly foe, someone they fear (even if they don’t admit it). The nature of this enemy is up to  you, but we suggest you consult with your GM. After all, your GM surely wants to bring this up in the game!  81–90   Obscurity:   Your character wishes to be remembered after they are gone and works tirelessly to secure their legacy.  91–00   Poverty:   For your character, it’s all about wealth and security. They fear being without, and they work hard to amass money,  supplies, and other valuable items to ensure their status. EXAMPLE: FEAR  Continuing our example, Katrina rolls on the chart  and determines that Akiko fears isolation. Since  Akiko is a clone (and thus is one of many, many  people who look the same), Katrina decides Akiko’s  Fear stems from feeling lost in a sea of identical  faces and worrying that nobody can recognize her  as different from her fellow clones. Katrina decides  that one way this shows is in Akiko’s preference for  outrageous, punk hairstyles and lots of facial pierc -  ings that make her look unique and memorable.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 49  thinking of when we say “Strength.” After all, physi -  cal features are advantages that you can add to your  character during the rest of the character creation  process, and wealth may be something your character  earns throughout their adventures (and loses just as  easily). What we’re thinking of are personality traits  that people are born with.  If you do not already have a Strength in mind for  your character, you may roll on   Table I.2–4: Example  Strengths   to determine one randomly. After rolling,  you should work with the GM to come up with specif -  ics surrounding the Strength.  f la W  Everyone has an element of themselves that they’re not  proud of. Why should your character be any differ -  ent? When someone speaks ill of your character, this is  always the first thing they bring up. It’s also what gets  mentioned when your character’s friends say “They’re a  great person, but…” That “but” is your character’s Flaw.  Just like your Strength, your Flaw is primarily a part  of your character’s personality. It is a selfish Motivation,  bad habit, or element of personality that your character  wishes they didn’t have.  If you do not already have a Flaw in mind for your  character, you may roll on   Table I.2–5: Example Flaws  TABLE I.2–4: EXAMPLE STRENGTHS  d100 Dice Roll   Result  01–10   Adaptable:   No matter what life throws at your character, they always rise to the challenge. Your character is flexible and can  handle nearly every situation, no matter how grim or strange the circumstances.  11–20   Analytical:   Your character’s mind is like a computer, able to absorb a barrage of information and come to a logical conclusion.  Your solutions always have the inarguable weight of reason, and you know how to pick your battles and when to bide your time.  21–30  Courageous:   Fear has no place in your character’s heart. They laugh at danger and gladly push themself to confront what others  flee from. Note that your character probably still has a Fear Motivation. It’s up to you whether that Fear is the one thing that can  undo your character’s courage, or if this Strength pushes them to confront the source of their Fear no matter what.  31–40   Curious:   Life is a million mysteries, and your character wants to learn about every one. Whether curiosity drives them to  meet new people, explore distant locales, or learn fantastic new truths and ideas is up to you.  41–50  Idealistic:   What ideals your character believes in are up to you, but to your character, those ideals are nothing short of sacred.  Your character may feel that everyone should live up to those same ideals (and may be disappointed when people don’t), or  they may be content to meet the standards they have set for themself.  51–60  Independent:   When everyone else has failed or fallen, your character knows they can still count on themself. Your character  may get along with others just fine but makes sure not to rely on others. That way, when things go wrong, your character is  always prepared to deal with the situation and isn’t waiting for someone else to help.  61–70  Patient:   Your character is always willing to wait and knows the power of being calm. By waiting for the right opportunity,  your character avoids all manner of unpleasant and dangerous situations. However, when such an opportunity presents itself,  your character acts swiftly and decisively.  71–80   Spiritual:   It doesn’t matter so much what your character believes in: that depends a lot on your game’s setting. What’s  important is that your character believes. Their belief gives them a solid mental bedrock they can always rely on.  81–90  Wise:   Through years of experience and countless events, your character has developed that rare quality: wisdom. The wise  understand the truths of how their world works. Just as importantly, they know that sometimes, with the right effort, those  truths can be overcome.  91–00   Witty:   Your character is extremely clever, with the right joke for a friend and the perfect insult for a foe. Some may love their  company, while others loathe their cutting remarks, but none can deny that your character has the sharpest tongue around. EXAMPLE: STRENGTH  We continue our example with Katrina rolling on  the Example Strengths chart and finding out that  Akiko is independent. This fits in with Akiko’s  desire to stand out from her fellow clones, and  Katrina figures this is also one of the reasons why  Akiko is a renegade clone in the first place. Her  independent streak caused her to buck authority,  break free of her indentured servitude as a clone,  and go on the run. EXAMPLE: FLAW  Finally, Katrina rolls to figure out Akiko’s Flaw. This  turns out to be intolerance. Katrina decides that  Akiko has a deep condescension (bordering on dis -  like) for other clones who follow her genetic template.  Because they look like her but are not her, Akiko con -  siders them to be inferior copies and is unable to rec -  ognize that each is an individual being. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 50  to determine one randomly. After rolling, you should  work with the GM to come up with specifics surround -  ing the Flaw.  m otivations   in   p lay  Motivations exist to offer you an additional framework  for how your PC interacts with the world. They estab -  lish your character’s priorities, but they need not be a  restriction. Rather, Motivations help to suggest your  character’s intuitive response to the challenges they  encounter. Notably, your PC’s reactions must be col -  ored by mitigating factors, so that a response is seldom  based solely on a Motivation.  c han G in G   m otivations  During play, your character’s attitudes, emotions, and  beliefs can and should evolve, especially if the GM has  been challenging the character’s inner state over the  course of the campaign. There may be single, dramatic  moments where it makes sense for your character  to change one or more facets of their Motivation, or  it might be a slower process that takes place over the  course of several sessions that have engaged your char -  acter’s emotions. Perhaps your character has achieved  their Desire, overcome a Flaw, or gained a new Fear.  When the narrative supports it, your GM should permit  you to erase an existing facet of their Motivation and  replace it with a new Desire, Fear, Strength, Flaw, etc.  Characters should not be permitted to continue  play without a replacement facet of their Motivation,  as these facets are essential components of roleplay -  ing and the hero’s journey. If the player is struggling  to come up with a new Motivation, the GM should  work with the player to invent circumstances that war -  rant a new Motivation. Alternatively, the struggle may  be a sign that the character’s emotional arcs have been  exhausted, and it is time to roll up a new replacement  character who has not had a chance to fully mature yet.  s ecret   m otivations  You can choose to share your characters’ Motiva -  tions with your fellow players, or to keep them secret.  Motivations for different characters can, at times, be  in direct conflict. By keeping these secret from one  another, you and your fellow players create opportu -  nities for potentially intense roleplaying between your  characters. Alternatively, by sharing their Motivations,  your group can better focus on the times when their  characters can collaborate.  TABLE I.2–5: EXAMPLE FLAWS  d100 Dice Roll   Result  01–10   Anger:   Your character lashes out at themself or others with undue cause or with extreme force. They are quick to resort to  physical force to solve their problems.  11–20   Compulsion:   This could be addiction, fascination, obsession, or another automatic behavior that is self-destructive or  otherwise impedes your character’s ability to function and be healthy.  21–30   Deception:   Your character may be disloyal or a compulsive liar. They are concerned with their own wellbeing first and  foremost, and they might always present themselves in the best possible light even when that isn’t the case.  31–40   Greed:   Your character is never satisfied with what they have, always wanting more. They are willing to flout the law or infringe  upon others’ rights in order to get what they want.  41–50   Laziness:   Your character always seeks the path of least resistance and becomes intimidated by difficult or complex tasks.  51–60  Ignorance:   Your character lacks a basic knowledge base or understanding of a society’s norms. This may be due to your  character’s upbringing or their recent travel to another area of the world. This could be more than just being “uneducated”; at  some level, your character may be willfully ignorant.  61–70  Intolerance:   For whatever reason, your character harbors some prejudices toward a group of people. These may be relatively  “minor” biases, or they may give rise to an intense emotion of hatred or revulsion. Whatever form it takes, remember that  intolerance is based more in emotion than rationality.  71–80   Pride:   Pride does not always have to be a Flaw, but it can easily become one. Your character is arrogant, vain, or self-absorbed,  or thinks highly of themself at the expense of others.  81–90   Recklessness:   Your character shows little regard for how their actions may affect themself or others, due either to low self-  esteem or lack of forethought. They are especially prone to dangerous or inconsiderate actions.  91–00   Timid:   Your character is extremely risk averse, opting instead to take more thorough or tried-and-true approaches. They may  take too long to act or may be unable to act at all in the face of new or intimidating challenges. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 51  s tep   7: C hoose   g ear ,   a ppearan C e ,   and   p ersonality  B y this point, you should have your character’s  background and Motivations pretty well figured  out, and all your starting attributes determined. The  only things left to do are purchase gear, come up with a  physical appearance, and finalize their personality.  s tartin G   G ear  Starting gear depends on the game setting. Obviously,  setting determines whether your character can buy plate  armor and a warhorse, or a bulletproof vest and a sports  car. However, the setting or type of game your GM plans  to run may also have an effect on how much starting  gear your character has. If your game exists in a post-  apocalyptic wasteland, your character may start with the  clothes on their back and a knife. On the other hand, if  your game involves playing a bunch of mercenaries in a  science fiction setting, your character may need to buy  powered armor, a Gauss rifle, and a drop ship!  For these reasons, while we offer a default starting  gear allowance, we fully expect your GM to change the  starting gear options as they see fit.   If you’re using the  default, your character starts with 500 currency to  spend on personal gear.   More on gear can be found on  page   82 , and in   Part II: Settings   starting on page 136.  Your character may keep any currency you don’t  spend. In addition, after you’ve finished purchasing  starting gear, roll a d100. Add the value of the die roll  to any remaining starting funds. This represents the  “pocket money” your character possesses. However,  since you generated it after you purchased starting gear,  you can’t use this currency to buy more starting gear!  a ppearance  A physical description is both one of the least and one  of the most important parts of your character. From a  mechanical perspective, none of our rules depend on  how your character looks. A tiny character can still  have a high Brawn, an ugly character can still have a  high Presence, and so on. However, a physical descrip -  tion is how you and your fellow players are going to  visualize your character throughout the game. Spend -  ing a little time thinking about a physical description  goes a long way toward bringing your character to life.  Inventing your character’s description is a process that  varies wildly depending on the character, the archetype  or species you chose, the way you customized your char -  acter, and the gear you purchased—and honestly, it’s  going to depend more than anything on you and your  mentality. So, we’ve provided a few things to consider  when you invent your character’s appearance:  •   What would go on your character’s driver’s license?  Most driver’s licenses ask for things like height,  weight, hair and eye color, and age. These are good  general starting points for a physical description.  •   If someone was describing your character, what  would they say?   When we describe people, we often  call out a few notable characteristics. “You remem -  ber Jim: he’s the short guy with the long white beard.”  “Sue’s the one with dreadlocks and green eyes who  walks with a limp.” If someone was describing your  character, what would they say about them?  •   What’s one body modification that would fit  your character?   Is there a tattoo, dyed hair, nose  piercing, or some other feature your character  might have chosen for themself?  p ersonality  Just like physical characteristics, your character’s per -  sonality is not something that matters for the rules, but  is going to do a lot toward defining how you play them  during the game. Also like physical descriptions, your  character’s personality depends a lot on you, the set -  ting, and all the character choices you made. However,  two choices define your character’s personality more  than the rest. Those choices are your character’s back -  ground and your character’s Motivation.  Where we come from and what our childhood was  like can do a lot to define our personality traits as  we grow older. First, consider your character’s back -  ground, and then decide how that may have affected  them (or, if it didn’t affect their personality, decide why  that may be the case). Then, consider your character’s  Motivation. After all, what we want to accomplish can  say a lot about how we act while striving for it.  Another way to develop your character’s personality is  to think of one word that you’d use to describe your char -  acter. “Bubbly,” “dour,” “helpful,” “relaxed,” “driven,” and  “sardonic” are all great places for a personality to start.  And that brings us to our final suggestion. Sometimes  you should start with a base, then let your character’s  personality evolve over time. Sometimes the best char -  acter personalities start with a single descriptor, then  gradually develop over the course of the game from the  choices you make. Don’t be afraid to leave a character  with room to grow and change. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 52  CHAPTER 3:   SKILLS  W hether flying through a canyon in a blistering-fast  starfighter or dueling a vampire on the rain-slicked  roof of a castle, we expect your character to do exciting  and dangerous activities in the course of their adventures.  Whether those exciting and dangerous actions succeed  or fail is determined by your character’s skills.  Skills represent what your character excels at doing;  the more ranks in a skill, the better your character per -  forms that skill. Anytime your character does something  that has a possibility of failure (and that failure has some  negative consequences for your character), your charac -  ter makes a skill check to see if they succeed or not.  As we’ve discussed previously, skills are used in con -  junction with characteristics to make checks. How this  works is covered on page   13 , but in brief, the higher of  the two values determines how many Ability dice   󲊷   you  add to your dice pool, and the lower of the two values is  how many of those   󲊷   are upgraded into Proficiency dice  󲊻 . Remember, in   Genesys , your character never makes  a check just using their skill, or just their characteristic.  W hat   a re   s kills ?  Technically, anything that your character might learn  could be considered a skill. However, that would lead  to a skill list that is ridiculously bloated and needlessly  specific. To avoid this, we’ve created a list of skills in  Genesys   that are fairly broad and focused on activities  that can lead to climatic moments in a story.  For instance, instead of having separate skills for  running, jumping, and swimming, we have the Ath -  letics skill. Someone with multiple ranks in Athletics  excels at all three activities. Likewise, we do not have  a skill for cooking, because preparing a well-cooked  meal is rarely a life-or-death situation. Instead, we have  the Stealth skill, because sneaking up on an unsuspect -  ing guard or trying to escape from a maximum security  prison probably is a life-or-death situation.  Skills are divided into four categories based on their  general application and use.   Combat   skills deal with how  a character may act and react in a physical confrontation.  Other skills may be useful during a fight, but generally,  your character uses combat skills to commit violence.  Social   skills, on the other hand, deal with how your  character may act and react in a social setting. They essen -  tially mirror combat skills; social skills are how your char -  acter interacts with others (without fighting them).  We classify skills that deal with general actions as   gen -  eral   skills. This category covers a wide range of activities,  from sneaking and picking pockets to healing friends.  Finally,   knowledge   skills are entirely cerebral. They  do not govern action—only understanding. We only  have one knowledge skill (called, appropriately enough,  Knowledge) that covers all topics of information. How -  ever, individual settings can have a wider variety of  knowledge skills covering a broader range of topics.  s kill   r anks  When a character chooses to attempt an action, the  player begins by forming a dice pool. The higher of the  relevant characteristic and skill ranks is used to deter -  mine the total number of Ability dice   󲊷   in the pool.  The smaller of these two values indicates how many of  those dice are upgraded to Proficiency dice   󲊻 . A char -  acter who has no ranks in a skill is considered to be  unskilled. This character has a value of 0 for the skill in  question, so their checks for that skill are made without  upgrading any Ability dice   󲊷   to Proficiency dice   󲊻 .  Aside from their use in the game mechanics, it may also  be useful to consider what skill ranks represent in a more  narrative sense. Even a single rank in a skill represents a  significant amount of time spent learning and practicing  it. We assume that most characters in your game world  can do the basic, everyday tasks related to a skill without  having a rank in that skill. For example, in a modern day  setting, most characters can drive a car but do not have  ranks in the Driving skill. The kinds of routine tasks they  perform almost never require a skill check (and if they do  need to make a skill check, they can still make the check  without having any ranks in the skill).  The first and second ranks of a skill represent a ground -  ing in that skill, but limited practical experience. At this  point, your character may have just completed a formal  education, taken part in an apprenticeship, or begun  an entry-level job. At this level of competency, your PC  knows the basics of the skill and can routinely succeed at  simple tasks, but is often overwhelmed by complex ones.  The third and fourth ranks are indicative of a true pro -  fessional. These are individuals who have honed the skill  thoroughly and can make their living at it. At this level,  characters might be talented and capable physicians,  respected pilots, or gifted mechanics. Routine tasks are  trivially simple, and these characters have the experience Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 53  to deal with complex tasks. They can even attempt a truly  formidable job with preparation and planning.  Only a handful of individuals attain the fifth rank of a  skill. Few can adequately appreciate the artistry of a mas -  ter’s craft, so those who attain this level must deliberately  challenge themselves to perfect their expertise. These  individuals are generally driven and passionate about  the skill that they have mastered.  s kill   D escriptions  This chapter details all of the skills used throughout the  game. Each skill comes with a basic description of what  it is and some brief suggestions for times your charac -  ter might use the skill and for some times when your  character wouldn’t use the skill.  When reading the description, remember that the  Your character should (and shouldn’t) use this skill  if…   sections are meant to be suggestions and guidelines,  not exhaustive lists. They should spur your imagination  and give you a frame of reference, not limit you.  Finally, each skill entry describes what settings that  skill is most appropriate for. Your GM can always decide  to use any skill in a setting, of course, but you should  check with your GM before you invest in the Computers  skill for a campaign in a steampunk setting, for example.  C hoosing   s kills  D uring character creation, you should think long and  hard about what skills to select for your character.  More than talents or characteristics, skills define what  your character is good at doing. If you’re making a medi -  eval knight, your character needs the Melee (Light) or  Melee (Heavy) skill (and the Riding skill if your setting  has a skill for horseback riding), lest they end up in their  first combat encounter and can’t use their sword very well!  Your choice of careers (see page   40 ) encourages you  to take certain skills over other skills. This can make your  choices for skill purchases easier. However,   Genesys  gives you a lot of freedom in your skill choices overall.  Therefore, you should consider what you want your char -  acter to focus in before you start spending XP on skills.  You may also want to talk to your GM about what kind  of game they plan to run, which should help you decide  what skills to invest in. However, no matter what kind of  game you’re playing, there are a few skills you (or at least  one person in your group) should consider investing in.  Unless your game is going to be completely devoid of  combat, you should probably consider investing in at least  one combat skill.

Likewise, unless your game is going to be a constant  dungeon crawl, at least some members of your party  should invest in social skills. Not everyone has to be a  smooth talker, but since social interactions are just as  important to roleplaying games as fighting, not being  able to interact in social encounters means you won’t be  interacting with a whole chunk of the game.  During adventures, you can expect characters to get  hurt. Medicine is a skill someone in your party should  invest in so they can patch up the other characters.  You should also consider investing in Cool or Vigi -  lance, since these skills help protect your character  from being affected by an opponent’s social skill checks.  Characters with high ranks in these skills are also more  likely to act earlier during a combat round.  Beyond that, the best piece of advice we can offer you  is to make sure your party has a diversity of skills as a  whole. It’s perfectly fine for characters to specialize, as  long as everyone doesn’t specialize in the same skill set. By  making sure your character doesn’t share the same focus  as your friends’ characters, you help guarantee that every -  one in your group gets their own chance to do something  awesome during the game, and you ensure there’s no chal -  lenge that your group can’t overcome by working together.  s o C ial   s kills  S ocial   skills   govern   social   interactions   between  characters. When your character uses these skills,  they try to convince, force, trick, or make a deal for an  opposing character to do something your character  wants. Thus, social skill checks are often opposed skill  checks. Check out the   Social Skill Interactions   side -  bar, on page   55 , for more about this and   Chapter 7:  Social Encounters , on page   118 , for more on social  encounters in general.  All   social skills work in all settings (after all, basic inter -  actions between people work the same in every setting).  c harm   ( p resence )  The ability to compliment, flatter, woo, and generally  make other people like you is something that’s pretty  important to a lot of player characters. For characters  who want to be likable, popular, and good at persuad -  ing other people to do what they want them to do,  Charm is the skill they rely on. A character with a lot of  ranks in Charm may be unctuous and insincerely flat -  tering, or maybe they’re just a genuinely nice person.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to persuade someone to do your  character a favor, especially if it might be inconve -  nient, expensive, or even dangerous for that person.  •   Your character tries to appeal to someone’s better  nature (even if it doesn’t exist!) to get them to do  something out of character for that person.  •   Your character tries to flirt with, seduce, or make a  romantic overture to someone.  •   Your character tries to make themselves look bet -  ter to everyone around them. A lot of politicians  and public figures have high ranks in Charm.  •   Your character performs in front of an audience, act -  ing, playing music, telling jokes, or giving a speech.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character is not at all sincere about what they are  saying or doing. If there’s duplicity or lying involved,  your character should use the Deception skill.  •   Your character is being polite, but subtly implying  a dditional   and   C usto M   s kills  Hey, GMs! We chose the skills included in   Gene -  sys   specifically because they are skills with broad  ranges of applications that should show up in  nearly every game and setting. Stealth, for example,  is important whether you’re sneaking up on orcs in  a forest or defense robots on a distant planet.  However, there are skills that are very important  in some settings, but not in others. Skills for fly -  ing spaceships are very important in science fic -  tion settings, but you’re not going to need them  in a fantasy setting. We’ve called these skills out  as only being appropriate for certain settings.  In addition, one of the great things about   Gene -  sys   is that you can make up the skills you feel are  important for your setting.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 55  violence or some other threat. In those cases, your  character should use the Coercion skill.  •   Your character uses their authority (either through  rank, station, or natural force of personality) to  give orders. These are times for your character to  use the Leadership skill.  •   Your character interacts with someone who is  already friendly to them, or asks someone to do  something that is not at all an inconvenience for  them (generally, you don’t need to use Charm to  ask your spouse to pick up something from the  store on their way home from work).  c oercion   (W illpo W er )  Some people believe that the only way to maintain respect  is to be feared. Others have learned that the best way to  get what they want is through screaming and the threat of  violence. When your character attempts to instill obedi -  ence in a target through the use of threats or acts of physi -  cal intimidation, they use the Coercion skill. Characters  with multiple ranks in Coercion are often intimidating,  scary, or even evil individuals. However, even good-  hearted people may use Coercion to intimidate oppo -  nents so they can win a fight without bloodshed.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character issues a threat, whether or not  accompanied by hostile actions. Even an implied  threat—such as gesturing toward a weapon—falls  under the Coercion skill.  •   Your character questions or interrogates a prisoner.  •   Your character uses physical or psychological torture.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character issues orders backed by the threat  of their authority (such as threatening troops with  courts-martial if they don’t follow your character  into battle). In cases like this, Leadership would be  a better skill for your character to use.  •   Your character tries to drive a hard bargain with  someone. As long as both sides are still getting  something out of the deal, Negotiation should be  the skill to use.  •   Your character interacts with someone who is  already terrified of or completely cowed by your  character. In these cases, any further threats would  be superfluous.  s o C ial   s kill   i ntera C tions  Social skills are an informal category of skills that  we’ve created. These skills are skills that your character  uses to interact with other characters, usually outside  of combat. Basically, these are the skills your character  uses when it’s time to talk, rather than fight.  Social skill checks generally use one of the following  skills: Charm, Coercion, Deception, Leadership, or  Negotiation. When your character is interacting one  on one with another character using these skills, the  check is usually an opposed check (see page   25 ).  This represents the fact that at their core, these social  interactions involve your character trying to influ -  ence the thoughts or actions of another character. The  other character is going to try to resist that influence,  either consciously or subconsciously.  Generally, the social skill used to interact with some -  one determines the skill that someone uses to oppose  it. In   Table I.3–2: Social Skill Interactions , we’ve  listed the five social skills, the skills generally used to  oppose them, and why. As always, of course, you can  make an argument that a different skill might make  more sense, but this table should serve as the baseline.  TABLE I.3–2: SOCIAL SKILL INTERACTIONS  Acting Skill   Opposing Skill  Coercion, Leadership   Discipline:   The mental fortitude to disobey orders, or the mental strength to resist interrogation and face  threats without flinching.  Deception   Vigilance:   The mental alertness to notice when someone is lying (since lies and deceptions, by their very  nature, are not something someone announces).  Charm   Cool:   The ability to keep calm and maintain composure when being charmed or flattered, and to respond  politely to flattery without giving away something or giving in to someone’s requests.  Negotiation   Negotiation:   Bargaining is usually a back-and-forth between two sides, with both sides using their negotiating  skills to try to get as much of what they want as possible. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 56  D eception   ( c unnin G )  When your character needs to lie to someone, they use  Deception. In fact, the Deception skill covers most  attempts to fool or deceive someone, which makes the  skill one of the more straightforward skills to use. One  thing you should keep in mind, though, is that although  lying is one of the most common ways to deceive some -  one, it’s not the only way. Your character may attempt to  trick someone by only telling them certain facts and omit -  ting others, or by using a misleading phrase. But even if  you argue that your character technically told the truth,  their actions still fall into the category of Deception.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tells a lie.  •   Your character tries to mislead someone through  clever wordplay or selective omission of certain facts.  •   Your character wears a disguise and pretends to be  someone else.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character actually believes the things they are  saying (even if they are objectively untrue).  •   Your character tells a “white lie,” a minor falsehood  to make someone feel better.  l ea D ership   ( p resence )  While some may follow out of a sense of duty or fear,  good leaders inspire their followers through a combi -  nation of charisma, bravery, and forceful personality.  We represent this quality through the Leadership skill.  Basically, Leadership is a combination of making smart  decisions, being firm and decisive when doing so, and  instilling a sense of loyalty and respect in your subordi -  nates. Leadership also represents your character knowing  the right decisions to make when authority is called for.  Obviously, military commanders rely on Leadership, as  do politicians, business owners, and even crime bosses.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character’s allies are suffering from fear (see  page   243 ), and you want to try to rally them.  •   Your character tries to convince a crowd of citizens  to take political action.  •   Your character leads troops into battle and wants  to make sure they follow your character’s orders.  •   Your character tries to convince a mob of rioters to  stand down and return to their homes.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character threatens to hurt or kill someone  if they don’t obey. This would be a good use of  Coercion, instead.  •   Your character tries to convince someone to do  something simply by being friendly and appealing.  Your character should use Charm here.  •   Your character has formal authority and issues  routine orders, especially outside of combat or  other stressful situations. If there is no good rea -  son not to obey your character (and your charac -  ter has the rank or station to issue orders), other  people are simply going to obey most mundane  commands automatically.  n e G otiation   ( p resence )  When your character wants to make a deal, they’re  going to use Negotiation. If Coercion is threatening  someone, Deception is lying to someone, Charm is  sweet-talking someone, and Leadership is telling some -  one what to do, Negotiation is convincing someone to  do what you want by giving them something they want  in return. The skill in Negotiation comes from getting  as much as you can out of a deal while offering as little  as possible to the person you negotiate with.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to purchase goods or services  and wants to haggle over the price.  •   Your character tries to sell goods or services and  turn a profit. In this case, your character needs to  use Negotiation to raise the price.  •   Your character attempts to broker a political agree -  ment or treaty between two parties.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character isn’t offering anything in return for  what they want. Getting something for nothing is  something your character can try to do using other  social skills, but Negotiation is predicated on the  idea of an exchange.  •   Your character tells someone what to do. Negotia -  tion has to be a bargain, so at the end of the inter -  actions, the opposing party has agreed to do some -  thing, not been ordered to do it.  •   Your character wants to buy something for a previ -  ously established price.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 57  g eneral   s kills  T his group of skills represents the majority of the  actions your character attempts, and is probably the  broadest category of skills in our game.  Some of these skills fit better in certain settings than  in others. We’ve gone ahead and noted which skills  make sense for which settings. GMs, you can choose to  ignore this advice for your own games if you like, but  make sure you inform your players what skills you’ve  decided to use or not use!  a lchemy   ( i ntellect )  Alchemy encompasses the knowledge and techniques  to brew potions and elixirs. Although Alchemy isn’t  considered a magic skill, the effects of your concoc -  tions may approximate or even truly be magical,  depending on the campaign setting. The limits of  alchemical creations are up to your GM, who will  assign difficulties to Alchemy checks appropriate to  the potency of the brew.  This skill should be used in the   fantasy ,   steampunk ,  and   weird war   settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to identify a potion by taste.  •   Your character wants to name the ingredients  needed for a certain elixir.  •   Your character tries to prepare a potion, elixir,  poultice, tonic, or similar compound with won -  drous or magical effects.  •   Your character attempts to prepare a remedy for a  disease or illness.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to enchant an otherwise  mundane liquid.  •   Your character desires to heal someone directly  through medical treatment of their wounds or lay -  ing on hands.  •   Your character seeks to transmute lead into gold.  That would clearly be magic!  a strocarto G raphy   ( i ntellect )  A galaxy is a big place, and characters in a space opera  game often traverse one (or more) quite a lot. The  Astrocartography skill covers the understanding, use,  and development of star charts, including mapping  undiscovered systems. It also covers your character  plotting courses for interstellar travel.  You should use this skill in the   space opera   setting.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character needs to set a course for a system  that is not easily reachable or widely known.  •   Your character tries to make sense of an ancient or  damaged star chart (whether physical or electronic).  •   Your character plots a course under stressful con -  ditions, such as trying to escape from enemy ships.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character pilots a vessel: your character uses  Operating when actually piloting a ship.  •   Your character navigates a planet’s surface, which  calls instead for Piloting or possibly Driving.  •   Your character travels a well-known route under  normal conditions, which shouldn’t need a check  at all.  d iffi C ulty   for   p otion   b rewing  As a guideline for GMs, the difficulty of pre -  paring a potion should generally correspond  to its rarity: generally by dividing the rarity  by 2 and rounding up. The resulting number  should be the difficulty of the check to brew the  potion. For instance, if your character wants to  make a healing potion (painkillers, page   94 )  of rarity 2, the base difficulty of the check is  Easy ( 󲊷 ) . If your character doesn’t have the  proper equipment or ingredients, the difficulty  may be higher. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

a thletics   ( b ra W n )  Your group’s characters lead dramatic lives filled with  constant physical feats. Sometimes they’ll be fighting  an opponent with a gun, but just as often they’ll be  climbing mountains, swimming across raging rivers,  and leaping across chasms. The Athletics skill deter -  mines how well characters perform these actions. It  serves as a measure of your character’s overall fitness  and physical conditioning. Those who actively engage  in a regimen of physical training, such as field infan -  try or scouts, are the most likely to have a high rank  in Athletics.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to climb up or down a  structure, particularly when the climb may be  tricky or the drop to the bottom is significant.  •   Your character tries to swim in difficult condi -  tions. High winds, waves, tides, and currents could  all contribute to making swimming difficult  enough to require an Athletics check.  •   Your character tries to jump, either ver -  tically or horizontally. Leaping across a  deep chasm or trying to jump up and  grab a fire escape to get away from  an angry dog are both situations  when   your   character   needs   to  make an Athletics check.  •   Your character attempts to run for  an extended time.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts an activity without  any chances of failure. If your charac -  ter swims on a calm day in a shallow  pond, goes for an early morning jog, or  jumps over a small log, they don’t need  to bother making a check.  •   Your character attempts a physical activity  that relies more on hand-eye coordination  and general agility than straight strength.  Engaging in parkour and freerunning,  swinging on a rope and rappelling down  a surface, and most forms of gymnas -  tics are activities better represented by the  Coordination skill.  c omputers   ( i ntellect )  The Computers skill grants your character proficiency  in the operation of computers and electronic sys -  tems. Possessing a lot of ranks in Computers might  allow your character to build computer systems, write  complex programs, design security systems, or even  (depending on just how advanced your setting is) cre -  ate lightweight AI for running simple constructs. In  addition, the Computers skill allows your character to  manipulate computerized systems in ways that might  be considered outside of the manufacturer’s specs. In  other words, it allows your character to do risky, pos -  sibly illegal things like hacking, encoding and decoding  encryption, and bypassing security systems.  You should use this skill in the   modern day ,   science  fiction , and   space opera   settings. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 59  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to pick an electronic lock,  access a building’s computing systems, or disarm a  high-tech security system.  •   Your character wants to crack the encryption on  secure files or messages.  •   Your character hacks into a database or computer  system, or defends against a hacking attempt.  •   Your character remotely pilots a small, hand-  launched drone to do more than just fly it around a  park. If a drone is big enough, like a Global Hawk  or other full-sized uncrewed aerial vehicle, the  Piloting skill might make more sense.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character has no risk of failure. Simple day-  to-day tasks like checking your email, browsing  social media on your phone, or watching a movie  on your tablet do not require a Computers check.  c ool   ( p resence )  Staying calm and maintaining composure, outwaiting  an opponent, generally being cool: these exemplify  things your character does with the Cool skill. Cool is  something of a defensive skill in nature, since it most  often comes up as the skill your character uses to resist  attempts to sway or affect them. Cool also represents  how your character appears to other people. If your  character doesn’t want to show that something affected  them, they would use the Cool skill to keep their emo -  tions invisible.  Even though Cool isn’t a social skill, it is often used in  social encounters. If you want to make a character who  is particularly effective in social encounters, you may  want to invest in Cool.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character begins laying a trap, staging an  ambush, or otherwise setting up a combat encoun -  ter in which your character initiates the combat  and has to judge the right time to do so.  •   Your character needs to stay calm and unaffected  when being flattered or charmed by someone.  •   Your character needs to refrain from saying or  doing something foolish during a tense situation.  •   Your character needs to keep their nerve in a tense  situation, such as when piloting one of two vehicles  headed toward each other at high speed.  •   Your character plays a card game or other game of  chance in which bluffing, luck, and gambling are  all intertwined.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to prevent being surprised. The  Vigilance skill would work better in that situation.  •   Your character tries to maintain inner self-control,  such as when meditating or resisting the effects of  fear. When your character is concerned with inner  composure, they should use the Discipline skill.  c oor D ination   ( a G ility )  In the course of adventures, characters sometimes find  themselves needing to stay stable on unsteady surfaces,  crawl through narrow openings, or even land safely after  a fall. Overcoming these types of challenges requires a  sense of balance and a heightened degree of flexibility,  both of which are represented by the Coordination skill.  Coordination serves as a measure of your character’s  flexibility, sure-footedness, and hand-eye coordination.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to swing back and forth on a  rope or rappel down a structure.  •   Your character walks across a narrow surface while  trying to keep their balance.  •   Your character tries to squeeze into a tiny or  cramped space such as a crawlspace, sewer pipe,  air duct, or narrow crevice.  h a C king   and   s ysops  If your setting puts a lot of focus on computers  and a futuristic Internet, then you may want to  split the Computers skill into two different skills:  Hacking and Sysops. Basically, Hacking is a skill  that covers all offensive computer actions, while  Sysops is the skill used to oppose any Hacking  attempts, find problems with a computer server  or program, and repair issues.  If this is something that interests you, you can  find more information on how to make your  own skills on page   190 . Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 60  •   Your character falls and needs to try to slow the fall  or land safely.  •   Your character needs to escape from physical  restraints (such as handcuffs or ropes) and wants  to contort their limbs or hands so that they can slip  out of their bindings.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to climb up or down a rope  or climb up a structure. This activity relies more  on strength than agility, and calls for an Athletics  check instead.  •   Your character falls from a short height or onto  something soft enough that they won’t suffer dam -  age when they land, or is in any similar situation that  has no consequences for failure (is lowered down a  structure in a firmly secured harness, for example).  D iscipline   (W illpo W er )  Discipline is your character’s ability to focus their  mind and quiet their thoughts. Discipline represents  your character’s maintaining self-mastery and focus,  specifically. Your character also uses Discipline to  overcome fear or terror and stay calm in the face of  the horrifying. In addition, Discipline represents your  character’s mental fortitude to resist threats or coer -  cion, or to disobey orders. Finally, in settings with  psychic powers, characters may use Discipline to con -  trol those mental arts.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character confronts something terrifying and  wants to avoid fleeing in horror (or to avoid other  debilitating effects of fear).  •   Your character tries to keep their sanity in the face of  something that defies reality and rational thought.  •   Your character wants to heal strain they are suffer -  ing from at the end of an encounter.  •   Your character wants to meditate, calm their mind,  and reach a mental equilibrium.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to keep their composure in a  social setting and avoid letting their emotions show.  Your character would make a Cool check instead.  •   Your character catches a lie as it is being told. Notic -  ing a lie depends on your character’s Vigilance.  Drivin G   ( a G ility )  The Driving skill includes the operation of all ground-  based vehicles, from simple automobiles to multi-car  locomotives to high-speed futuristic driving pods. The  types of vehicles depend a lot on the setting, of course.  Regardless, if something uses a motor and traverses  land, this is the skill you’ll use to operate it.  You should use this skill in the   steampunk ,   weird war ,  modern day ,   science fiction , and   space opera   settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character wants to bring a vehicle to a safe  stop after one of its tires is damaged.  •   Your character tries to keep up speed while round -  ing hairpin curves when driving a vehicle.  •   Your character attempts to catch up to someone  else in a vehicle (if the target is on foot, a check  should only be necessary if they try to escape in a  crowd or through a narrow space).  •   Your character swerves to avoid an animal darting  across the road, or tries to avoid a falling rock on a  winding mountain pass.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character operates an aircraft of any kind; this  would call for the Piloting skill.  •   Your character drives a vehicle under normal con -  ditions (and at safe speeds) without any immediate  danger, which shouldn’t require a check at all.  •   Your character attempts to modify a vehicle to  improve its speed; the Mechanics skill is more  appropriate for this.  m echanics   ( i ntellect )  The Mechanics skill allows your character to build,  disassemble, repair, or modify just about anything  mechanical, from a broken radio to a wrecked gyro -  copter. In addition, the Mechanics skill is used when  salvaging technology, building fortifications, or trou -  bleshooting a malfunctioning water pump, or any  time your character needs to swing a hammer or turn  a wrench. Depending on the setting, this skill may  focus on different elements. In a fantasy or other low-  technology setting, this skill may cover smithing and  crafting (and could potentially be called something  more appropriate).  You should use this skill in all settings.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 61  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character needs to repair a damaged weapon,  vehicle, or other piece of equipment.  •   Your character needs to identify any parts or tools  necessary prior to completing a job. This can save  time and money on the project.  •   Your character has access to a supply of compo -  nents and tools and wants to design a completely  new device.  •   Your character needs to sabotage an enemy’s vehi -  cle or find a weak point in their defenses.  •   Your character needs to build an item or modify it.  •   Your character tries to install and modify cyber -  netic implants (although if you want, working on a  cybernetic implant may require a Medicine and a  Mechanics check to represent the fusion of human  and machine).  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character has just a simple task like refueling  a vehicle, hanging a door, or changing the batteries  in a flashlight.  •   Your character wants to program an application for  a device. That would require a Computers check.  m e D icine   ( i ntellect )  In the course of their adventures, we expect your  character to suffer injuries: everything from cuts and  bruises to broken bones and bullet wounds. Medicine  gets your character and their friends back on their feet.  Any attempt to heal an organic character requires Med -  icine, as do other medical procedures such as elective  surgery and installing cybernetics, and working with  poisons, diseases, parasites, and drugs.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   They or another character has suffered wounds,  and your character wants to heal those wounds.  •   Your character tries to counteract or administer  a poison.  •   Your character needs to cure a disease.  •   Your character creates a new pharmaceutical (or  recreational) drug.  •   They or another character has suffered a Critical  Injury, and your character wants to heal it.  •   Your character performs a complex medical proce -  dure such as surgery, cybernetic augmentation, or  psychotherapy.  M edi C ine   C he C k   d iffi C ulty  When you attempt to heal a Critical Injury, the dif -  ficulty is set by the injury in question (see page   114  for more on Critical Injuries). However, when heal -  ing wounds, the difficulty is determined by how  badly injured the target is. We did this to mirror  real life; bandaging a painful cut is a lot easier than  trying to set a broken bone. The more wounds a  character suffers, the more injured they are and the  harder it should be to repair those injuries.  We also cover the details of healing in   Chapter  6: Combat Encounters , page   95 , but here are  the basics. As you can see on   Table I.3–3: Medi -  cine Check Difficulty   in the next column, the  difficulty of the check varies depending on how  many wounds the target currently has. When your  character makes a successful Medicine check, they  heal a number of wounds on the target equal to  the number of   󲊳   your character’s check gener -  ates. The target also heals an amount of strain  equal to the number of   󲊴   generated.  Three final notes: Any one character can only make  one attempt to heal a particular Critical Injury per  week of game time. Also, any one character can only  benefit from one Medicine check per encounter.  These limits exist to prevent characters from con -  stantly repeating checks until their patient is in perfect  health. Finally, if your character tries to heal themself,  they increase the difficulty of the check by two. Hey,  it’s a lot harder to set your own broken arm!

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 62  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character researches a disease or poison.  While studying a disease or poison directly might  require Medicine, the act of researching requires a  Knowledge check.  •   Your character tries to heal their own strain at the end  of an encounter. Recovering from strain at the end of  an encounter requires Discipline or Cool.  •   Your character tries to administer poison through  slight of hand, such as by dropping it in a drinking  cup or surreptitiously injecting it into an unsus -  pecting target. The inherent subterfuge in this  activity makes that a Skulduggery check.  o peratin G   ( i ntellect )  Sometimes, a vehicle is so big that quick reflexes and  a steady hand aren’t enough to operate it. When using  these sorts of vehicles, for which your character needs  training, a sharp mind, and the ability to keep track of a  lot of information, your character employs the Operat -  ing skill. Operating represents your character’s ability to  drive, pilot, fly, or sail anything big. Ships, dirigibles, and  spaceships (really, anything with a crew) all require the  Operating skill. In low-tech settings, your character may  use this skill to steer and sail a sailing ship. In steampunk  settings, Operating could be used to pilot a war zeppe -  lin. In modern day or weird war settings, your charac -  ter needs this skill to sail a merchant steamer or pilot a  submarine. In the science fiction or space opera settings,  your character uses Operating to pilot large spaceships.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your clipper must safely ride out a storm without  losing speed (or a mast).  •   Your character pilots a zeppelin to slip around the  stern of an opponent’s flying fortress.  •   Your   character   calculates   an   orbital   slingshot  maneuver for their starship.  •   Your character docks a spaceship with a space station.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character performs routine ship maneuvers  in open space.  •   Your character wants to upgrade the engines of the  ship. That requires a Mechanics check.  •   Your character is the captain of a ship and is giving  orders. This requires the Leadership skill.  p erception   ( c unnin G )  When your character wants to make an active attempt  to study their surroundings, notice clues in a crime  scene, or search for hidden foes, they use the Percep -  tion skill to do so. Perception represents your char -  acter’s conscious use of all five senses to observe their  environment (or, if you’re playing some sort of alien  species, your character may have more than five). In  any case, the most important point is that Perception  represents your character’s active use of these senses.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character wants to search a crime scene for clues.  •   Your character wants to study the surrounding  landscape for possible threats.  •   Your   character   conducts   surveillance   on   an  unaware target from a distance.  •   Your character studies an ancient relic, trying to  spot any minute details that could reveal its pur -  pose or construction.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to avoid being surprised dur -  ing an ambush. Constant, unconscious awareness  of your character’s surroundings is a function of  the Vigilance skill.  •   Your character is being lied to, and you’re trying  to find out if your character noticed or not. Again,  Vigilance is the skill for this situation.  •   Your character tries to follow a trail or track a foe  through the wilderness. The Survival skill covers  these activities.  p ilotin G   ( a G ility )  This skill covers the operation of any aerial vehicle that  requires reflexes and hand-eye coordination to oper -  ate, from gyrocopters and helicopters, to jet fighters  and gliders, all the way up to starfighters and space-  capable drop ships. As with the Driving skill, the type  of vehicles involved depend on the setting. Regardless,  if something flies through the air or through space and  requires a pilot with quick reflexes and a hot hand on  the throttle and joystick (or their equivalent), then  you’ll need Piloting to operate it!  This skill should be used in the   weird war ,   modern  day ,   science fiction , and   space opera   settings. (You  can also use it in the   steampunk   setting if there are Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 63  gyrocopters or other personal flying vehicles other  than large, rigid airships.)  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character needs to land an airplane with one  (or both!) engines out.  •   Your character tries to outmaneuver opponents in  a dogfight.  •   Your character flies a drop ship through a maze of  needle-sharp rock spires to a landing zone.  •   Your character attempts to land a personal dirigi -  ble while under fire from an enemy airship.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to repair a damaged air -  craft propeller or engine, a task that calls for the  Mechanics skill.  •   Your character drives a car off a precipice and wants  to land with as few fatalities as possible; that’s still  Driving (and likely with a pretty high difficulty!)  •   Your character fires a weapon mounted on a vehicle,  which requires a Ranged or Gunnery check.  •   There is no chance of catastrophic failure when  operating the vehicle. Checks are not required for  simple tasks like flying in open skies with light wind.  r esilience   ( b ra W n )  When the going gets tough, the tough rely on their  Resilience skill to keep going. Resilience represents your  character’s ability to overcome pain and fight through  fatigue. Characters with ranks in Resilience are also bet -  ter at resisting poisons and diseases, and surviving hos -  tile environments. When your character stumbles into  a small Alaskan town after surviving two weeks on the  frozen tundra, they have their Resilience skill to thank.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to go without sleeping for days  on end, and you need to see if they stay awake.  •   Your character ingests a toxin, and you need to see  how bad the effects are.  •   Your   character   endures   a   hostile   environment  (somewhere too hot, too cold, or even too pol -  luted) for days on end.  •   Your character attempts to recover from a Critical  Injury on their own, without medical attention.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to do something that isn’t  beyond the limits of normal endurance. Going for  a day-long hike wouldn’t call for a Resilience check  unless the hike is through the Rocky Mountains in  a snowstorm.  •   Your character immediately stops and rests to  recover fully at the end of the activity. If there’s no  need to track lasting consequences, there’s no need  to make the check.  r i D in G   ( a G ility )  Sooner or later, characters in a fantasy campaign are  going to want to use mounts. These are most likely  horses, but the same skill is used for riding anything  from donkeys to giant insects. In most settings, it can  be assumed that everyone knows the basics of riding  a saddled horse, and a skill check is only required for  pursuits, races, or riding in dangerous conditions.  You should use this skill for the   fantasy   and   steam -  punk   settings (in other settings, where riding is not an  everyday occurrence, you can use the Survival skill to  ride and handle animals).  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character flees from pursuers who are also  mounted, or fast enough to potentially catch up.  •   Your character tries to joust at a tournament.  •   Your character competes in a friendly (or not so  friendly) race.  •   Your character tries to catch up to enemies with a  significant head start.  •   Your character’s mount panics during a storm,  and your character needs to get the creature  under control.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character travels without any immediate danger.  •   Your character makes an attack from horseback.  The additional difficulty brought about by attack -  ing from a horse should be factored into the com -  bat check’s difficulty, generally in the form of one  or more   󲊸 .  •   Your character tries to tame a wild animal. In this  case, your character uses the Survival skill. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 64  s kul D u GG ery   ( c unnin G )  Most roleplaying games have a long and storied tradi -  tion of characters disarming traps, picking locks, and  (if those tasks fail) breaking out of prison. In our game,  characters perform those activities with the Skuldug -  gery skill. Skulduggery covers a combination of skills  your character would use to engage in covert or crimi -  nal activity. If you’re building a character you’d consider  a “thief ” or “rogue,” this is one skill you should pick up.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to pick someone’s pocket  or lift their wallet.  •   Your character tries to pick a lock or disable a trap.  Your character would also use Skulduggery to set a  trap in the first place.  •   Your character wants to study a security system.  •   Your character attempts to distract an opponent  through guile or a feint, such as by throwing a  handful of dirt in their eyes during a fight.  •   Your   character  tries   to   surrepti -  tiously slip a poi -  son into someone’s  food or drink.  y our   character   shoul D  not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your   character  attempts to sneak  into   a   location  unnoticed. Your  character   needs  to make a Stealth  check instead.  •   Your   character   attempts   to   pick  someone’s pocket when that person  is   helpless   or   incapacitated.   This  doesn’t require a check at all.  •   Your character tries to make a poison. Your char -  acter needs Medicine to make poisons or toxins,  but they do need Skulduggery to use them.  s tealth   ( a G ility )  When your character wants to act unnoticed by anyone  else, they use the Stealth skill. In many ways, Stealth is  one of the simpler skills, and it covers a pretty specific  set of activities. However, being stealthy is something  that comes up in many roleplaying games, so it tends  to be a very useful skill to invest in.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to hide from someone.  •   Your character tries to tail someone through a  crowd, and to do it without being noticed.  •   Your character tries to infiltrate a government  installation while avoiding both electronic security  and human guards.  •   Your character tries to move quietly through a house.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to pick someone’s pocket. Your  character needs Skulduggery for this activity.  •   Your character tries to remain hidden when their  opponent has no chance of spotting them, such as  if they try to avoid being seen by an aircraft during  a blizzard at midnight. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 65  •   Your character has no realistic chance of hiding  from an opponent, such as if trying to hide from a  nearby person while in the middle of miles of salt  flats at noon.  s treet W ise   ( c unnin G )  Some call it the “school of hard knocks,” while others  refer to it as “street smarts” or “gut instincts,” but in all  cases, the Streetwise skill is your character’s ability to sur -  vive and thrive in rough and dangerous urban areas. If  your character has ranks in Streetwise, they instinctively  know how criminals tend to operate, which locations to  avoid after dark, where to go to obtain illicit drugs and  services, and other information crucial for making their  way in the seedy underbelly of a major city.  In many ways, Streetwise can be thought of as the  urban counterpart to Survival. They both represent  many of the same activities, but Streetwise applies to  urban areas, while Survival applies to the wilderness.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character looks for a merchant who sells  black-market goods or illegal services.  •   Your character wants to understand particular ref -  erences or slang in a conversation.  •   Your character tries to approach criminals and  start up a conversation without appearing like an  outsider or a threat.  •   Your character tries to find their way around an  unfamiliar city.  •   Your character tries to track and hunt someone  somewhere in a city.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to find their way around a  rural or wilderness environment. In this case, your  character should be using Survival.  •   Your character interacts with the upper crust of  society. Charm (or possibly Deception or Coer -  cion) may serve the character better here.  •   Your character has already established themself as  a member of the criminal underworld, and is con -  tinuing to interact with other criminals. Streetwise  lets your character fit in, know how to act, and  know what topics to bring up and what to avoid.  However, it shouldn’t replace social skills.  s urvival   ( c unnin G )  There are a thousand tricks your character needs to mas -  ter in order to survive in the wilderness, and the more  ranks in Survival they have, the more likely they are to  know them. The Survival skill covers your character’s  ability to find food and water, cope with dangerous con -  ditions, hunt and skin animals, and, well, survive in any  location that doesn’t have a supermarket on the corner.  In many ways, you can think of Survival as the rural  counterpart to Streetwise. They both represent many of  the same activities, but Survival applies to the wilder -  ness, while Streetwise applies to the big city.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character is trapped in the wilderness and  needs to find food and potable water.  •   Your character needs to notice approaching severe  weather and know how to prepare for it.  •   Your character needs to follow a crude map or direc -  tions through a rural area to find a specific location.  •   Your character tries to tame or calm a wild animal,  or handle a domesticated animal.  •   Your character hunts something (or someone!)  through a wilderness setting.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character uses a highly accurate and detailed  map to find a location.  •   Your character tries to find their way around an  urban environment. In this case, your character  should be using Streetwise.  •   Your character interacts with an animal that already  likes or respects your character, or your character  asks an animal to do something completely within  their nature (they wouldn’t need to make a Survival  check to get a dog to play “fetch,” for example).  v i G ilance   (W illpo W er )  Vigilance represents the ability to be constantly aware  of your surroundings, often without consciously mak -  ing the effort. Characters with ranks in Vigilance are  more likely to spot threats in their environment, notice  important clues out of the corner of their eye, and catch  lies as they’re being told.  You probably noticed from the description that Vigi -  lance, more than most other skills, is a bit of a passive Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 66  skill. In fact, Vigilance is supposed to be used when  your character doesn’t expect a threat, isn’t looking for  a clue, or is otherwise unaware of something important.  This is why we use it to determine Initiative in combat  when a character is surprised, to see how much that  character was paying attention. It also means that when  your GM asks you to make a Vigilance check, you may  suspect that something is up. Your character, however,  shouldn’t be suspicious (unless they pass the check!)  Vigilance is also one of skills that you use to oppose  certain social skill checks (primarily Deception) when  those checks target your character.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character just got ambushed, and you are roll -  ing to determine Initiative order. A high Vigilance  means your character has a better chance of react -  ing quickly to the threat.  •   Your character is being lied to; the opponent’s  Deception check is opposed by your character’s  Vigilance skill.  •   Your character has a chance to notice important  details in their surroundings while not looking for  them directly.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   You are determining Initiative order when your  character is not surprised (such as when they are  the ambushers, instead of the ambushed). In this  case, your character uses Cool instead.  •   Your character actively looks for something. This  calls for a Perception check.  k nowledge   s kills  K nowledge and information in a roleplaying game  can be a tricky subject. Consider how much you  know about the world you live in. In a fantasy world,  characters should know every bit as much about their  fictitious setting as you know about the real world  around you.  Realistically, this is impossible unless you memorize  a gazetteer or world guide of the same size and level  of detail as the Encyclopedia Britannica. To bridge that  gap, we have knowledge skills. When the GM needs to  determine whether your character knows something,  they can have your character make a Knowledge skill  check. Success means your character knew it all along,  even if you didn’t!  Knowledge skills also let you make characters who  are smarter than you are. That way, when your character  needs to recalculate the orbital trajectory of a malfunc -  tioning ballistic missile in the next five minutes, they  can make a Knowledge skill check and scribble out the  answer on the back of a cocktail napkin even if you the  player wouldn’t know where to begin!   Knowledge skills  let us all make information a bit more abstract and keep  games from getting bogged down in technical minutia.  k no W le DG e   ( i ntellect )  In the core of   Genesys , we only have one knowledge  skill. Appropriately enough, we call it Knowledge.  Knowledge is a very broad skill that represents your  character’s grasp of anything there is to know, from  physics and biology, to quantum mechanics, to art his -  tory and philosophy.  Not every character is going to be a math prodigy and  a philosopher and a historian all in one, so it’s up to you  to determine what kind of knowledge your character  specializes in. Also, you should note that just because  a character doesn’t have ranks in Knowledge doesn’t  mean they are completely ignorant. We assume every -  one has some basic knowledge of how the world works  and, depending on the setting, probably has the equiva -  lent of a primary school education. A couple of ranks  in Knowledge may represent some sort of secondary  school or apprenticeship, while more ranks may rep -  resent the equivalent of a college education. Five ranks  may represent being a true prodigy in a specific field.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character tries to find out if they know an  important fact about the world around them.  •   Your character tries to do something academic,  such as calculate a theorem, conduct an experi -  ment, or write a history thesis.  •   Your character tries to research a particular topic.  •   Your character performs critical thinking or tries  to figure out a logic puzzle. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 67  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character needs to know information that is  fairly simple or trivial. Asking someone to add 2+2  shouldn’t require a check, for example.  •   The answer your character is looking for can easily  be found in an accessible, easily referenced data -  base, perhaps one that is electronic and accessed  through a worldwide communications network.  Whether or not your character can apply this  information, however, may be determined by a  Knowledge check.  C o M bat   s kills  C ombat skills feature pretty prominently in most  games you’ll be playing with   Genesys . Basically,  when your character needs to punch, shoot, stab, or  wrestle someone, they use a combat skill to do so. Com -  bat skills determine how good your character is with  weapons, how likely they are to hit a target, and even  how much damage they do if they hit.  In the   Genesys   core game, we have three   combat  skills. The Brawl skill represents your character’s ability  to punch, kick, wrestle, and generally fight with their  hands. The Melee skill governs your character’s ability  to fight in hand-to-hand or “close” combat with weap -  ons like swords, knives, and clubs. The Ranged skill is  how your character attacks foes from a distance.  These skills are very broad, and deliberately so! We  made the skills all-encompassing because what com -  bat skills are applicable in a game is going to depend a  whole lot on the game’s setting. That’s also why the for -  mat for these skills is different than in other sections.  The Melee and Ranged skills both have a number of  sub-skills listed after the main entry. Most settings focus  more either on Melee or on Ranged combat, so in those  settings, we break up either the Melee or the Ranged  skill into its constituent sub-skills to make combat more  interesting (Brawl always stays as a single skill). That  way, instead of buying just one combat skill to be good  at all elements of a type of combat, you have to special -  ize your character more. It keeps that skill from becom -  ing an automatic choice for all characters, and helps dif -  ferent fighting characters feel more unique.  Since combat is a big part of structured gameplay  (and involves its own specialized set of rules), we  include a lot of specifics on how to use combat skills  starting on page   95 .  b ra W l   ( b ra W n )  The Brawl skill is what your character uses to fight any -  one who’s right in front of them, rather than beyond  arm’s reach, when your character is fighting without  any weapons. Martial arts, wrestling, and unarmed  combat are all covered by this skill.  You should use this skill in all settings.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with their bare hands or  a weapon specifically designed to augment an  unarmed attack, such as cestus or brass knuckles  (or even a roll of coins).  •   Your character tries to pin, grapple, or hold someone.  •   Your character uses some form of unarmed martial art.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a projectile weapon  or a thrown weapon. If your character is target -  ing someone who is not within arm’s reach, they  should be using the Ranged skill.  •   Your character tries to fix or modify a melee  weapon. Repairing or creating weapons is usually  handled by the Mechanics skill.  m elee   ( b ra W n )  The Melee skill is what your character uses to fight  anyone who’s right in front of them, rather than  beyond arm’s reach, when using a weapon. This skill,  in its broadest interpretation, covers any sort of hand  or melee weapon.  a dditional   k nowledge   s kills  Although we only provide one knowledge skill in  Genesys , we fully expect that you can add your  own knowledge skills to your own setting. Simply  jot a list of some of the particular topics you think  your characters need to know about in your game,  then look at our guidelines for creating a skill, on  page   190 . If you do create new knowledge skills,  however, you should get rid of the single, all-  encompassing Knowledge skill we present here! Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 68  You should use this skill (instead of one of its sub-  skills) in the   steampunk ,   weird war ,   modern day ,   sci -  ence   fiction , and   space opera   settings (or in any setting  where most fighting is done with firearms).  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a sword, rapier, dirk,  mace, axe, spear, halberd, knife…we could go on,  but you get the idea.  •   Your character fights in a duel.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a projectile weapon or a  thrown weapon. If your character targets someone  not at arm’s reach, they should use the Ranged skill.  •   Your character tries to fix or modify a melee  weapon. Repairing or creating weapons is usually  handled by the Mechanics skill.  m elee   ( l i G ht   )  In settings with an emphasis on fighting hand-to-hand,  the Melee (Light) skill is what your character uses to  fight with pretty much any close combat weapon they  can wield in one hand. This includes swords, knives,  maces, clubs, and countless similar weapons.  You should use this skill in the   fantasy   setting.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a rapier, dirk, mace,  one-handed axe, light spear, sword, katana, knife,  or other weapon easily wielded in one hand.  •   Your character wants to hit someone with their shield.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a halberd, greatsword,  flail, maul, or other large weapon that requires two  hands to wield.  m elee   ( h eavy   )  In settings with an emphasis on fighting hand-to-hand,  the Melee (Heavy) skill is what your character uses to  fight with large, heavy weapons that take both hands to  swing properly. This includes mauls, greatswords, flails,  halberds, and countless similar weapons.  You should use this skill in the   fantasy   setting.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a halberd, greatsword,  flail, maul, or other large weapon that requires two  hands to wield.  •   Your character picks up a heavy tree branch and  tries to crush someone’s skull with it.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a rapier, dirk, mace, one-  handed axe, light spear, sword, katana, knife, or other  weapon that can be swung easily with one hand.  r an G e D   ( a G ility )  While the Melee skill is what your character uses to  fight anyone who’s right in front of them, the Ranged  skill is what your character uses to fight everyone else.  Your character uses this skill to fight with any sort of  ranged weapon, from bows and arrows to particle beam  cannons. They’re also going to use this skill if they want  to throw things at someone.  You should use this skill (instead of one of its sub-  skills) in the   fantasy   setting (or any setting where most  fighting is done beyond arm’s reach).  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with a crossbow, longbow,  blowgun, pistol, rifle, machine gun, laser pistol,  missile launcher…again, you probably get the idea.  •   Your character uses the weaponry of a vehicle such  as the cannon on a tank, the machine guns on a  fighter plane, or the Gauss rifles on a starfighter.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character fights with any kind of close combat  weapon. Those are handled by the Melee skill.  •   Your character uses a ranged weapon to hit some -  one within arm’s reach, such as by taking the butt  of their rifle and using it like a club. Even though  they’re using a ranged weapon, they’re using it as  if it were a melee weapon, and the check should be  handled by the Melee skill.  •   Your character tries to fix or modify a ranged  weapon. Repairing or creating weapons is usually  handled by the Mechanics or Knowledge skill.  r an G e D   ( l i G ht   )  In settings where your characters do most of their fight -  ing with firearms, your character uses Ranged (Light)  to shoot pistols, throw knives, and toss grenades at  their opponents. This skill covers pretty much every  light ranged weapon designed to be fired (or thrown)  from one hand.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 70  M agi C   s kills  M agic skills are a unique subset of skills that only  work if your setting includes magic and the magic  alternate rules found on page   210 . Make sure your set -  ting includes these rules before you start taking ranks in  these skills!  You should use these skills in the   fantasy   setting. It is  not uncommon for the   steampunk   and   weird war   set -  tings to also include magic, so potentially you can use  those skills in these settings as well. If you’re using the  modern day   setting to emulate the urban fantasy genre,  you’ll include magic and   magic skills in that setting, but  you’re very unlikely to see magic in other settings.  a rcana   ( i ntellect )  The Arcana skill represents your ability to manipulate  magical energies, whether they are the fundamental  forces of nature or power drawn from an unnatural  source. Magic is used to cast spells and identify sources  of magic in the world. It also includes your general  knowledge of magic and its function. The Arcana skill  is not, however, used for magic derived from the gods  or similar divine sources; that would be the Divine skill.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character wants to throw a fireball at a group  of enemies.  •   Your character tries to use a crystal ball to observe  the movements of a distant individual.  •   Your character attempts to erect a magical barrier  to block a passage.  •   Your character wishes to curse a foe and bring mis -  fortune on their actions.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to invoke the power of a  deity to smite their foes.  •   Your character seeks to contact the spirits of the  dead to consult them in some business.  •   Your character attempts to heal an ally.  D ivine   (W illpo W er )  So-called “divine magic” is the ability of priests, holy  warriors, and their like to produce miraculous effects  by invoking or channeling the power of their deity or  faith. For many practitioners, this is completely differ -  ent from magic, but many others see little practical dis -  tinction between the alleged sources of the wondrous  effects worked by mages and priests.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character lays hands on someone to heal their  wounds or disease.  •   Your character calls on the strength of their faith to  bolster an ally.  •   Your character prays to their deity for a sign.  •   Your character presents their holy symbol in an  effort to turn back the undead.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character wants to fling arcane energy at a liv -  ing enemy.  •   Your character recites scripture in an attempt to  sway a crowd. This would require the Charm or  Leadership skill.  •   Your character tries to counter an enemy’s spell.  p rimal   ( c unnin G )  The Primal skill represents the ability to tap into the  natural energies that infuse most worlds. Often viewed  as primitive and uncivilized, Primal magic still can  be incredibly powerful, as it draws on the life-force of  every living thing around you.  y our   character   shoul D   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character wants to heal a friend.  •   Your character attempts to communicate with  plants or animals or gain the cooperation of natu -  ral forces.  •   Your character wishes to manipulate or control the  weather, including summoning storms or throw -  ing lighting at foes.  y our   character   shoul D   not   use   this   skill   if   …  •   Your character attempts to fire a magic bolt at an  enemy or group of enemies.  •   Your character tries to raise or reanimate the dead.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 71  CHAPTER 4:   TALENTS  T alents generally represent specialized techniques  that a character has mastered, typically through  intense practice and study. A character is likely to be  more successful when engaged in actions for which they  have appropriate skills and talents.  Generally, skills are what your character uses to per -  form a task. If your character wants to climb a wall,  they use the Athletics skill. Talents, on the other hand,  modify how a character uses that skill (such as rerolling  a failed Athletics skill check when attempting) to climb  that wall). Talents may also modify some of your char -  acter's other attributes (such as changing their wound  threshold), or perform actions normally not allowed by  the rules (such as ignoring Critical Injuries).  To get a talent, you spend some of your experience  points on it. Each talent has an experience point cost based  on how powerful the talent is (more on that in a minute).  t alent   t ypes  There are many different types of talents. Some are asso -  ciated with an individual skill or closely related group  of skills. These tend to be particular knacks that a char -  acter has acquired through the process of mastering  that skill. In many cases, talents represent operational  shortcuts—corners an experienced individual knows  can be safely cut or particularly effective methods they  can follow. Other such talents are simply natural abili -  ties that fit in especially well with the use of that skill.  These could include a certain mental process, a physi -  cal technique, or a learned pattern. A number of talents  are specifically associated with conflict and fighting.  These combat talents represent techniques that a char -  acter likely learned through practice and experience.  t alent   t iers  Some talents are better than others. They may have more  exciting abilities or just better mechanical boosts for  your character. To balance these talents out and create  an opportunity for characters to progress toward better  abilities, this system sets different talents at different tiers.  Each tier determines how much a talent costs in  experience points.  •   Tier 1: Each talent costs 5 XP.  •   Tier 2: Each talent costs 10 XP.  •   Tier 3: Each talent costs 15 XP.  •   Tier 4: Each talent costs 20 XP.  •   Tier 5: Each talent costs 25 XP. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 72  When you are buying talents for your character, you  must follow one simple rule. After buying the new tal -  ent, your character must have more talents in the next  lowest tier. So, if your character has two Tier 1 talents,  they can only have a single Tier 2 talent, and can’t have  any Tier 3 talents. But if your character has four Tier 1  talents, they can have three Tier 2 talents, two Tier 3  talents, and a single Tier 4 talent.  The character sheet on pages 254-256 comes with  a talent worksheet. As you can see, as your character  buys more talents, you create the opportunity to buy  more talents from higher tiers.  t alent   r anks   an D   p urchasin G   the   s ame   t alent  m ultiple   t imes  Most talents can only be purchased once. However,  some talents are ranked, which means they can be  purchased multiple times. These talents have a cumu -  lative effect: the more of them you purchase, the bet -  ter they become.  However, after you purchase the talent, the talent now  counts as being in the next highest tier for the next time  you want to purchase it. This means the experience cost  goes up (since talents in higher tiers cost more), and  this new version of the talent takes up one of your more  valuable talent slots in the higher tier (the first version  you purchased still takes up its original slot).  If a ranked talent is already at Tier 5 (or has reached  Tier 5 after multiple purchases), that talent remains at  Tier 5 for any future purchases.  This system is designed to encourage some difficult  choices (do you keep buying more ranks in a single tal -  ent or buy the exclusive, high-tier talents when you get  access to them?), and it helps ensure that every charac -  ter feels a bit different.  t alent   d es C riptions  T he following is a breakdown of each talent. Each  part of a talent entry conveys specific information.  •   Name:   Every talent has a name, making it easy for  you to refer to the talent, and hopefully providing  a bit of a colorful description as well!  •   Tier:   Each talent belongs in one of five tiers, as we  described previously in this section. The higher the  tier, the more XP it costs for your character to pur -  chase the talent.  •   Activation:   Some talents, once chosen, constantly  apply to your character; these are passive talents.  Toughened, which increases your character’s wound  threshold, is one such talent. Once you buy it, your  character always has a higher wound threshold.  Other talents are active, which means you choose  when your character uses the talent. Natural, for  example, lets you reroll one check in a game session,  and you choose when your character uses it. If a tal -  ent is active, it has additional details in parentheses  describing how much time and effort it takes for your  character to use the talent (see page   97   for more on  actions, maneuvers, and incidentals). Finally, you can  use most talents only on your character’s turn, but  some talents can be used during another character’s  turn. These talents have the “out of turn” descriptor.  •   Ranked:   Some talents are ranked, which means  your character can take them more than once. We  described ranked talents in more detail earlier.  •   Rules:   These are the rules that describe what the  talent does.  t alent   e ntries  The following is a list of talents that are fairly univer -  sally usable in the different genres and settings for  this game. The talents are grouped by tier, and in each  grouping, the talents are listed alphabetically.  If you’re a Game Master, keep in mind that this doesn’t  have to be the complete list of talents for your players.  Each talent has a brief descriptor at the end that talks  about what settings it may be appropriate for. Most are  appropriate for all settings, but not all. You can always  rule these talents as off-limits for your game; just be sure  to tell your group. Also, be sure to read pages   194 -198  for more on how you can build your own talents.  t ier   1  b ou G ht   i nfo  Tier:   1  Activation:   Active (Action)  Ranked:   No  When making any knowledge skill check, your char -  acter can instead use this talent to spend an amount of  currency equal to fifty times the difficulty of the check  and automatically succeed on the knowledge check with  one uncanceled   󲊳   (instead of rolling).

This animal must be silhouette  0 (no larger than a mid-sized dog). The bond persists as  long as your character chooses, although at your GM’s  discretion, the bond may also be broken due to abusive  treatment or other extenuating circumstances.  As long as the bond persists, the animal follows your  character, and you dictate the animal’s overall behav -  ior (although, since the animal is only bonded with the  character, not dominated, it may still perform incon -  venient actions such as scratching furniture, consum -  ing rations, and marking territory). Once per round  in structured encounters, your character may spend  one maneuver to direct their animal in performing  one action and one maneuver during your character’s  turn. The animal must be within hearing and visual  range of your character (generally medium range) to  do this. Otherwise, the animal does not contribute to  the encounter. The specifics of its behavior are up to  you and your GM.  For every additional rank of Animal Companion your  character has, increase the allowed silhouette of the  companion by one (this may mean your character gets  a new companion, or their companion grows in size).  This talent can also change in flavor depending on  the nature of your game setting.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 82  CHAPTER 5:   EQUIPMENT  W hatever adventures your characters go on, we  expect they need some items to aid them. These  could be spacesuits and laser guns, swords and plate mail,  or a laptop computer and protein bars. These things may  seem different, but we categorize them all as equipment.  This chapter discusses the rules for equipment, spe -  cifically weapons, armor, and items that can’t be cat -  egorized as either. We explain how to buy and sell these  items and some of the details about them (such as item  qualities and encumbrance), and then we give you a  few example items and explain how they work.  The one thing this chapter doesn’t have is a long list of  different weapons, armor, and gear. The reason is that  specific items are very setting dependent. While your  character may be armed with a laser pistol in a futur -  istic setting, the same laser pistol doesn’t make a lot of  sense in a fantasy setting. So, instead of trying to cover  every single item you may find in a variety of settings,  we’ve provided a couple of examples to explain how  various item profiles work. If you want more extensive  equipment lists, check out   Part II: Settings   and the  equipment lists in the specific settings.  r arity  S ome items are naturally more difficult to purchase  than others, depending on where your characters  find themselves at any given time. Of course, some items  are rare no matter where one goes, and likewise, some  items are always common and inexpensive.  Rarity in   Genesys   measures how difficult an item can  be to find on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being the easiest to  track down and 10 being the hardest. However, whether  or not an item is available for purchase should never be  solely a matter of rolling dice. Instead, your Game Mas -  ter always has at least partial say as to whether an item  is available in a certain location. Nevertheless, for simple  items, rarity provides a simple way for your GM to deter -  mine whether something is available and to let you easily  track items down. We suggest that you make a success -  ful Negotiation, Streetwise, or Knowledge skill check to  determine where your character can find an item.  Table I.5–1: Rarity   lists rarities, the corresponding  check difficulty to find items with those rarities, and  examples of items with those rarities. The examples are  all modern day examples; if you need to invent rarities  for new items in different eras, check out our different  example settings starting on page 138.   Table I.5–2: Rar -  ity Modifiers , on the next page, lists some general modi -  fiers that can be applied to an item’s rarity, based on the  technological status and general location where your  character is looking for the item. We’ve kept the loca -  tion descriptions very vague; they could apply to dif -  ferent cities or villages on Earth, or to different planets  across a galactic civilization. Modifiers can raise an item’s  rarity above 10. For rarities higher than 10, the difficulty  remains at   Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) , but your GM may  upgrade the difficulty once for every rarity beyond 10.  s ellin G   an D   t ra D in G  Although we don’t expect your games to constantly  involve adventures in commerce, nearly every roleplay -  ing game involves selling items at one point or another  (even if your character is just selling items looted from  the corpses of their foes).

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 83  When selling an item, your character needs to make  a successful Negotiation check. Use the difficulty set by  the item’s rarity (as determined by   Table I.5–1: Rarity ).  Your characters can generally sell an item for one-quar -  ter of its cost if the check is successful, increasing that to  one-half with   󲊳   󲊳   and to three-quarters with   󲊳   󲊳   󲊳  or more.  In some cases, the PCs might wish to engage in trade,  buying multiple items at one location and then selling  them at another location where they are rarer. We gen -  erally advise that you handle this narratively. However,  if your GM wishes to use some mechanical guidelines  for this process, we’ve provided some basic rules that  cover trading.  Trade works the same whether with black-market  items or with legal items. Selling either type of item  follows the rules listed previously with the caveat that  trading in legal items requires a Negotiation check,  while trading in illegal items requires a Streetwise  check. However, when determining the sell price based  on the success of the Negotiation or Streetwise check,  first multiply the cost of the item by the difference  between the item’s rarity where it was bought and its  rarity where it is to be sold, referring to   Table I.5–2:  Rarity Modifiers   and   Table I.5–3: Increased Costs  When Trading . Then take the new, increased cost and  determine the sell price by the results of the Negotia -  tion or Streetwise check.  Of course, these rules do not account for all sorts of  details, such as buying in bulk, marketing and adver -  tising, and myriad other factors that may affect prices.  This is why the rules for buying, selling, and trading are  all modifiable by the GM and subject to their judge -  ment. It is also important to note that these rules only  apply when engaging in commercial trade. So, if your  group sells a load of guns in a town, then later your  character buys one of those guns in that town, they’re  going to have to pay the usual, listed price for the gun.  Don’t try to use these guidelines for trading and selling  in bulk to cheat the system!  The final thing to remember is that your GM always  has the final say on what can be sold, where it can be  sold, and how much it can be sold for. Because this isn’t  likely to be a major part of the game, we deliberately  made a system that is simple and doesn’t account for  a lot of the variables that would normally matter when  trying to sell an item. If your GM wants to stop your  characters from selling cell phones to a village with -  out any cell service, or have an arms dealer decide that  turning your characters in to the government for a  reward is a better deal than what you’re offering, they  are well within their rights to do so.

Sometimes this commerce happens  in an actual market, but more often, such deals  happen through a labyrinthine web of contacts,  cutouts, and middlemen.  If your characters want to buy something that  happens to be illegal, they’re probably going to  have to go into the black market to do so. Buying  and selling on the black market follows all the  same rules as regular buying and selling, except  that instead of making a Negotiation check to  find items or determine the price your character  can sell them at, they need to make a Streetwise  check instead.

e n C u M bran C e  G enesys   emphasizes sweeping stories, epic tales,  and fast action. Keeping track of the weight of every  piece of loose change isn’t fun, but knowing that your  character has to carry a child out of a burning building  is an important story element; so is having some idea  of how many days’ worth of rations your character can  carry while journeying in the wilderness.  In general, you and your Game Master won’t need to  track your character’s encumbrance (how much they’re  carrying on their person). Occasionally, however, it  may play an important part in the story, and you need  to know if the weight, mass, and collective bulk of the  items your character is wearing inhibit their actions.  e ncumbrance   v alues  Every item of gear listed has an encumbrance value.  Most items that can commonly be carried have a value  between 0 and 5—from relatively light objects (such as  wallets or light clothing) to heavier items (like hunting  rifles or tool kits). We discuss the encumbrance value  of armor in more detail later, but the one difference is  that when your character is wearing armor, its encum -  brance goes down. Just imagine wearing a chain-mail  shirt. It’s pretty heavy, but now imagine carrying it in  your hands. That’s going to be a lot more cumbersome  since you can’t distribute the weight across your torso  and shoulders, and you don’t have your hands free.  Encumbrance doesn’t strictly represent weight: it  also represents mass, bulk, and how easy items are to  carry. A well-fitting suit of plate mail adds very lit -  tle encumbrance, while an armful of logs has a high  encumbrance. The plate mail may weigh more, but  it’s designed to be worn and fitted to a person, while  a stack of unbound logs is both heavy and awkward to  carry.  Small items, such as candles, most pistols, and knives,  have an encumbrance value of 1 or 2. Medium items,  such as rifles, a satchel of grenades, or a grappling hook  and cord, have an encumbrance value of 3 or 4. Large  or heavy items, such as cargo crates, light machine  guns, or a heavy toolbox, are valued at 5 or 6.  If it becomes critical to the story to have more  detail, ten loosely carried incidental items have an  encumbrance value of 1. If they are stored in an  effective manner—such as keys in a pocket or  crystals in a pouch—then twenty incidental  items have an encumbrance value of 1. If,  for some reason, your character is unable  to manage their gear in such a way, the  GM may increase the items’ over -  all encumbrance value by several  points to reflect the difficulty of  managing and carrying items  by less efficient means.  When   carried,   a   living  being   generally   has   an  encumbrance   value   of  5 plus Brawn. A typical  human has a Brawn of  2, and therefore a total  encumbrance value of 7. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 85  e ncumbrance   t hreshol D  All characters have an   encumbrance threshold   of 5  plus their Brawn rating, which limits how much they  can carry under normal conditions without penalty. A  total encumbrance value over the threshold means the  character is “encumbered,” and suffers   󲊸   to all Agil -  ity and Brawn-based checks for every point of encum -  brance over the limit. And of course, this is cumulative  with any other   󲊸   the character may be suffering.  Further, if a character is encumbered by an amount  equal to or greater than their Brawn rating, they no lon -  ger earn a free maneuver each turn. The character can  still perform up to two maneuvers, but each maneuver  costs 2 strain. With a Brawn of 2, for example, a char -  acter would not get a free maneuver each turn if they’re  carrying nine or more points of encumbrance.  l iftin G   an D   c arryin G   e xcessive   e ncumbrance  Characters shouldn’t typically carry more than their  encumbrance   threshold.   When   necessity   demands,  however, they can do so for a short time (suffering the  effects described above).  If your character needs to lift an object with an  encumbrance value greater than their encumbrance  threshold, such as an ally who has fallen off a gantry  or ledge, they must make an Athletics check. The dif -  ficulty is   Easy ( 󲊷 )   if the object’s encumbrance value is  one more than your character’s encumbrance threshold.  You should increase the difficulty by one for every addi -  tional point over, up to a maximum additional encum -  brance of 4 and difficulty of   Daunting ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) . A  character with a Brawn of 2 and a threshold of 7, for  example, tries to lift a rock with an encumbrance value  of 10. That’s 3 over, so the difficulty is   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) .  Additional characters may help, adding their raw  Brawn to the encumbrance threshold of the charac -  ter trying to lift or carry the object or objects. In the  example, a person with a Brawn of 2 adds +2 to the  encumbrance threshold for that specific task.  c oncealin G   G   ear  We assume that your character is going to want to hide  items on their person at some point. Maybe they’re  concealing a weapon, or maybe they want to sneak a  valuable item out of a restricted area. In any case, we do  have some simple rules for hiding stuff.  Items with an encumbrance value of 1 or less can be  hidden on a person easily. You don’t need to make a  check for your character to hide the item. Instead, if  another character tries to search your character, the  searcher makes an   opposed Perception check vs. your  character’s Stealth . Add   󲊸   to the searcher’s check  for every encumbrance value over 1 that is due to the  hidden item. If there are multiple items, use the item  with the highest encumbrance value to determine how  many   󲊸   to add.  In some cases, your character’s opponents may not  specifically be checking your character for hidden  items, but may just be keeping an eye out for anything  odd in general (such opponents could include a sentry  at a city gate, or a police officer walking the beat). In  these cases, the searcher would make an   opposed Vigi -  lance check vs. Stealth   instead of a Perception check.  The same rules can apply to similar situations—such  as hiding a rifle (encumbrance value 4) in a dumpster  full of trash. In this case, your Game Master should  decide what encumbrance value of object can be hid -  den without being noticed, and add   󲊸   for every point  over that. EXAMPLE: LIFTING EXCESSIVE ENCUMBRANCE  Kara and Grace are trying to steal a box of min -  ing explosives as part of the plan for an upcom -  ing heist. Grace, who is trying to run with the box  in her arms, has an encumbrance threshold of 7  (5 plus her Brawn of 2). The box’s encumbrance  value is 5. Grace is also trying to carry a shovel  (3 encumbrance value) and her pistol (2 encum -  brance value), so Grace is carrying 3 over her  threshold. She loses her free maneuver and adds  󲊸   󲊸   󲊸   to all Agility and Brawn-based checks she  makes. Finally, she needs to make a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  Athletics check   just to move the crate, and since  Athletics is Brawn-based, she’s going to be adding  those three   󲊸   to the check. EXAMPLE: HELPING CARRY  Kara, seeing that her friend Grace can’t carry a  box of explosives, a shovel, and her handgun,  decides to help. She grabs one end of the box, so  that now the two of them are carrying it together.  Kara has a Brawn of 3, so she adds 3 to Grace’s  encumbrance threshold. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 86  i te M   q ualities  S ome equipment features special qualities that add  variety and depth to the weapons, armor, and items  your character may encounter. In our game, item quali -  ties are special rules that can change how the item acts.  They let us add more variety to an item than we could  by only manipulating its raw characteristics. They also  make the items more interesting for you, since many  qualities may require you to think about your character  using that item differently.  Special qualities are generally either passive or active.  Passive qualities are always “on” and require no activa -  tion on the part of the user. Active qualities must be  triggered by the user, often by spending one or more   󲊴  to activate the effect.  Item qualities usually have a number associated with  them. This is their rating. Ratings affect qualities in dif -  ferent ways, depending on the quality in question.  Active qualities require   󲊴   󲊴   to activate unless oth -  erwise stated in their description. Active item qualities  on weapons can only trigger on a successful attack,  unless specified otherwise.  Finally, we should note that not all of these quali -  ties are appropriate for all settings. However, we have  included the complete list of item qualities here, par -  tially because it’s not all that long, and partially because  most of the qualities are general enough that with the  right tweaks to their flavor, you could actually justify  them in more settings than you would expect.  a ccurate   ( p assive   )  Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether  through design or technology. For each level of this  quality, the attacker adds   󲊸   to their combat checks  while using this weapon.  a uto   - f ire   ( a ctive   )  A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid  succession and potentially spray an area with bolts,  flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advan -  tage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit  multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times.  As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally  less accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty  of the combat check by   󲊷 . The user may choose not  to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case,  they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer  the aforementioned penalty.  If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire  by spending   󲊴   󲊴 . Auto-fire can be triggered multiple  times. Each time the attacker triggers Auto-fire, it deals  an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an  additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base  damage plus the number of   󲊳   on the check.  These additional hits can be allocated to the original  target, or to other targets within range of the weapon.  If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must  decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if  they wish to hit multiple targets, their initial target must  always be the target with the highest difficulty and high -  est defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses  which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be  against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can  be allocated to any of the other designated targets.  Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical  Injury for each hit generated on the attack, per the nor -  mal rules; the Critical Injury must be applied to the tar -  get of the specific hit.  b last   ( a ctive   )  The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or  a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a  warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is  successful and Blast activates, each character (friend  or foe) engaged with the original target suffers a hit  dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus  damage equal to the total   󲊳   scored on the check.  In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master  might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage.  If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still  detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the  firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means  b ase   d a M age :   w hat   is   i t ?  Some qualities talk about a weapon’s or attack’s  base damage . What we mean by that is the dam -  age listed in the weapon’s profile, without any  modifiers added from talents or successes.  If the weapon is a weapon that has a damage that  is added to one of the user’s characteristics (usu -  ally Brawn), then the base damage is the weap -  on’s damage plus the user’s characteristic. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 87  the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. How -  ever, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by  spending   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴 . In this case, the original target and  every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit  dealing damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.  b reach   ( p assive   )  Weapons   with   Breach   burn   through   the   tough -  est armor; they are often heavy weapons or weapons  mounted on some sort of vehicle.  Hits from weapons with the Breach quality ignore one  point of vehicle armor for every rating of Breach (mean -  ing they also ignore 10 soak for every rating of Breach).  b urn   ( a ctive   )  Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When  Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues  to suffer the weapon’s base damage each round for a  number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating.  Apply damage at the start of each of the target’s turns.  If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn,  the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a  different target each time.  A victim might be able to stop the damage by per -  forming an action to roll around and make a Coordi -  nation check. The difficulty is   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )   on hard  surfaces such as the floor of a building, or an   Easy ( 󲊷 )  on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water  stops the damage immediately. Both situations assume  the flame is from actual combustion rather than a  chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little  the victim can do.  c oncussive   ( a ctive   )  The weapon’s attack can leave the target shell-shocked  from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable  to perform any but the most basic actions. When Con -  cussive is triggered, one target hit by the attack is   stag -  gered (see page   114 ) for a number of rounds equal to  the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target can -  not perform actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from  a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered  multiple times, affecting a different target each time.  c umbersome   ( p assive   )  A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward,  or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly,  the character needs a Brawn characteristic equal to  or greater than the weapon’s Cumbersome rating. For  each point of Brawn by which the character is deficient,  they must increase the difficulty of all checks made  while using the weapon by one.  D   efensive   ( p assive   )  An item with the   Defensive quality increases the user’s  melee defense by its Defensive rating.  D   eflection   ( p assive   )  An item with the   Deflection quality increases the user’s  ranged defense by its Deflection rating.  D   isorient   ( a ctive   )  A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When  Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is dis -  oriented (see page   114 ) for a number of rounds equal  to the weapon’s Disorient rating. A   disoriented target  adds   󲊸   to all skill checks they perform. If multiple tar -  gets suffer hits from a weapon with Disorient, the qual -  ity may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different  target each time.  e nsnare   ( a ctive   )  A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts their  movements. When Ensnare is triggered, one target hit  by the attack becomes   immobilized (see page   114 )  for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ensnare  rating. An immobilized target cannot perform maneu -  vers. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with  Ensnare, the quality may be triggered multiple times,  affecting a different target each time.  An Ensnared target may perform an action to attempt  a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Athletics check   on their turn to break  free from the effect.  G   ui D e D   ( a ctive   )  A weapon with the Guided quality can track opponents.  The Guided quality can only be triggered if an attack  misses. If Guided is triggered, the controlling charac -  ter may make a combat check at the end of the round as  an out-of-turn incidental. The difficulty of this combat  check is   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) ; instead of building the ability  of the pool normally, add   󲊷   equal to the weapon’s Guided  rating. If the check is successful, the weapon strikes the  target, and the attack is resolved normally.  Guided requires   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   to activate, unless otherwise  specified in the weapon’s description. The Guided quality  can activate on any subsequent combat check it makes,  representing the projectile continuing to track the target.  i naccurate   ( p assive   )  Inaccurate weapons are less likely to be accurate or pre -  cise. When making an attack with an Inaccurate weapon,  add   󲊸   to the check equal to the Inaccurate rating. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 88  i nferior   ( p assive   )  An Inferior item is a lackluster example of its kind, repre -  senting shoddy and poor craftsmanship. An Inferior item  generates automatic   󲊱   on all checks related to its use.  k nock D o W n   ( a ctive   )  When Knockdown is triggered, one target hit by the  attack is knocked prone. If multiple targets suffer hits  from a weapon with Knockdown, the quality may be trig -  gered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.  Unless specified otherwise, Knockdown requires   󲊴  󲊴   to trigger, plus one additional   󲊴   per silhouette of  the target beyond 1.  l imite D   a mmo   ( p assive   )  Some weapons fire particularly large or complex pro -  jectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are  expendable weapons like grenades that, once used, are  destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality  may be used to make a number of attacks equal to its  Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a  maneuver. In addition, each shot expends one of a lim -  ited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be  purchased or obtained before anyone fires the weapon  again. This also applies to grenades and other “one-use”  weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here,  your character is not “reloading” the grenade, but draw -  ing another to use—mechanically, they are equivalent).  l inke D   ( a ctive   )  Some weapons are designed to fire together at the same  target (turrets housing multiple guns are a good exam -  ple of this). When a character fires a linked weapon,  on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The  wielder may spend   󲊴   󲊴   to gain an additional hit, and  may do so a number of times equal to the weapon’s  Linked rating. Additional hits from the Linked weapon  may only be applied against the original target. Each hit  deals the weapon’s base damage plus damage equal to  the   󲊳   scored on the check.  p ierce   ( p assive   )  Any hits from this weapon ignore a number of points  point of soak equal to the weapon’s Pierce rating. If the  weapon has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total  soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For exam -  ple, Pierce 3 against a soak of 2 ignores two points of  soak, but the extra point of Pierce has no further effect.  p repare   ( p assive   )  Items with this quality require time to set up before  being used. The user must perform a number of  preparation maneuvers equal to the item’s Prepare  rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon,  “using” it would be making attacks with the weapon).  At your GM’s discretion, moving with the item, being  knocked prone with the item, or other disruptions may  require the user to perform the preparation maneuvers  again before using the item.  r einforce D   ( p assive   )  Weapons or items with the Reinforced quality are  immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Rein -  forced quality make the wearer’s soak immune to the  Pierce and Breach qualities.  s lo W - f irin G   ( p assive   )  Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage,  but need time to recharge or cool down between shots.  A weapon’s Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of  rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired  again after attacking. For example, a heavy laser cannon  with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being  fired before it can be fired again.  s tun   ( a ctive   )  A weapon with Stun can deal strain to the target. When  the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts   strain equal to  the weapon’s Stun rating. Since this is strain, and not  strain   damage , it is not reduced by the target’s soak.  s tun   D   ama G e   ( p assive   )  A weapon with this quality can only deal strain dam -  age (damage applied to the target’s strain threshold).  Because this is strain   damage , not strain, it is still  reduced by a target’s soak.  s un D er   ( a ctive   )  When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item  openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or  item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor  if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from moder -  ate to major. If an item already suffering major damage is  the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed.  Sunder requires   󲊴   to activate, and may be activated  even if the attack is unsuccessful. Sunder may be acti -  vated multiple times in the same attack, but each activa -  tion must be applied to the same item, potentially tak -  ing it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.  s uperior   ( p assive   )  A Superior item is a sterling example of its kind, rep -  resenting masterful craftsmanship. A Superior item  generates automatic   󲊴   on all checks related to its use. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 89  t ractor   ( p assive   )  Instead of firing searing beams of laser fire or crackling  ion discharges, this weapon fires relatively harmless elec -  tromagnetic beams that ensnare ships and hold them  fast in space. Tractor beams, like all weapons, are fired  at their target using the appropriate skill check with all  suitable modifiers. Once the weapon hits its target, the  target may not move unless its pilot makes a success -  ful Piloting check with a difficulty equal to the tractor  beam’s rating. If the target is an individual character, the  character is   immobilized while the beam is active.  (Weapons with the Tractor quality are only going to  show up in sci-fi settings, and probably only the more  fanciful sci-fi settings! However, they are such a staple  in those settings that we included the quality here.)  u n W iel D y   ( p assive   )  An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be par -  ticularly awkward to use for those without impres -  sive dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield  an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an  Agility characteristic equal to or greater than the weap -  on’s Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which  the character is deficient, they must increase the diffi -  culty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.  v icious   ( p assive   )  When an attack with this weapon results in a Critical  Injury or Hit, the character adds ten times the Vicious rat -  ing to the Critical roll. With Vicious 3, for example, you  would add +30 to the resulting   Critical Injury or Hit result.  i te M   M aintenan C e  I nvariably, items start to wear down. Rolling   󲊲   may  indicate a item has malfunctioned, misfired, jammed,  broken down, or otherwise been rendered inoperable or  impaired until it can be repaired.  All items, from low-tech weapons to more sophisti -  cated devices, can be repaired with the Mechanics skill.  Item damage are generally classified as minor, mod -  erate, or major. The magnitude of the required repairs  indicates two things: the severity of any penalties applied  to the user when trying to operate the defective item, and  the difficulty rating of the necessary repairs. Repairing  an item requires adequate time and tools, generally one  to two hours per difficulty level. If a character attempts  repairs in less time, the difficulty increases by one. Like -  wise, if the character lacks the proper tools, the difficulty  increases by one. These factors are cumulative, so if your  character tries to repair a pistol without the proper tools  and in half the time it would normally take, you should  increase the difficulty of the check by two.  The cost of repairs is equal to a percentage of the item’s  base cost: 25% if it’s a minor repair, 50% if it’s a moderate  repair, and 100% if it requires major work. Reduce the  total by 10% for each   󲊴   received on the repair check if  your character is doing the work themself.  t ra C king   a MM o  Combat in our game tends to be fast-paced and  narrative based, with rounds lasting an unspeci -  fied amount of “game-world” time and combat  encounters usually wrapping up in a few total  rounds.   That   narrative-driven   approach   also  means that when your character attacks with a  ranged weapon, one attack could represent a sin -  gle, carefully lined up shot, or a few shots snapped  off with a pistol.  All this means that we really encourage you  and your GM not to worry too much about  ammunition. Carefully tallying how many bul -  lets your character has in the clip goes against  the   Genesys   game experience (and the long-  standing traditions of most action movies).  A better way to approach the issue of ammo is to  use any   󲊲   generated on a combat check to make  the character’s ammo run out (something we  suggest on page   104 ). It’s more cinematically  exciting, and certainly feels like something that  would come from rolling a   󲊲 !  The only exception is when a weapon has the  Limited Ammo quality. We reserve that quality  for weapons like rocket launchers, grenades, or  other weapons that very obviously can only fire  once before reloading!

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 90  w eapons  I n our game,   weapons have a number of distinct char -  acteristics, which is how we define them in the game  and delineate their capabilities. All weapons share the  characteristic categories that we cover here.  Some also come with unique rules, which we cover in  the weapon’s individual entry. Those rules are so special -  ized that making them universal would just create clut -  ter in our general rules, since they won’t come up often.  c haracteristics  The following are a weapon’s characteristics.  n ame  What we call the weapon.  s kill   u se D   ( s kill   )  All weapons require a  combat skill to oper -  ate, and this entry  defines   which   skill  the weapon requires.  Skills also can determine  whether a weapon requires  one or two hands to wield. The  “Heavy” version of the skill means  the weapon takes two hands to use, and  the “Light” version of the skill means it can  be used with one hand. If the setting uses the  unspecified version of each skill, the weapon can be  used one-handed unless it says otherwise in its entry.  Gunnery weapons always require two hands to use.  b ase   D   ama G e   (D   am   )  The base damage the weapon inflicts. This is the mini -  mum damage inflicted if the attack with this weapon  hits. Each   󲊳   the combat check generates adds one  point of damage to this base damage rating.  Some weapons (including most Melee and Brawl weap -  ons) have a “+” in front of their base damage. This means  you add your character’s Brawn rating to this value.  c ritical   r atin G   ( c rit   )  Indicates the number of   󲊴   required to trigger Criti -  cal Injuries using this weapon. If the weapon’s Criti -  cal rating triggers, the character rolls percentile dice  on   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result , on page   115  to determine the effect on the target. A Critical Injury  can only be triggered on a successful hit that inflicts  wounds on the target.  Some weapons and talents modify this Critical roll,  potentially making a Critical Injury more or less effec -  tive. In addition, a character can only generate one  Critical injury per hit on a target. However, if the check  generates enough   󲊴   to trigger the Critical rating of the  weapon multiple times, the character can choose to add  +10 to the Critical roll for each trigger after the first.  More on Critical Injuries can be found on page   114 .  r an G e  The range of the weapon. Range  is measured in several broad  range bands. Melee weap -  ons   usually   require   the  attacker to be engaged  with   the   target.  Ranged   weapons  have   ranges   listed  as short, medium,  long, or extreme. See  pages   102   and   105  for more information.  e ncumbrance   ( e ncum   )  Encumbrance   is   an   abstract  measurement of how heavy and  awkward something is to carry  and transport. The higher the encum -  brance, the more difficult the item is to carry. More details  on encumbrance can be found on page   84 .  p rice  The price of the weapon on the open market.  r arity  The rarity of the item, before modifiers (see page   82 ).  s pecial  These are the qualities or other special rules each  weapon possesses. More in-depth descriptions of these  qualities can be found on page   86 , while rules spe -  cific to a certain type of weapon are detailed in the  weapon’s individual description. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 91  w eapon   d es C riptions  H ere we’ve included two weapons, a knife and a  revolver. As we mentioned at the beginning of the  chapter, we’re not going to include an extensive armory  in this section, since weapons depend a great deal on the  setting you’re playing in. These two, however, are basic  enough that they provide us a chance to demonstrate  how Melee and Ranged weapon profiles look.  Normally, we present weapon entries in a series of  paragraphs with headers. We then present their charac -  teristics in a single, consolidated table to save space.  k nife  This is our profile for a standard knife. The profile is  general enough that this could work for a knife carried  in the belt of a medieval noble, a weapon bought at a  sporting goods store today, or part of the gear of an  interstellar soldier of the future.  Since the weapon is a Melee weapon, it uses the  Melee skill. The damage it can deal depends on the  Brawn of the user, so it has a “+” next to the damage  entry to signify that you’d add your character’s Brawn  rating to the number to figure out its base damage. +1  damage means it does not do a great deal of damage,  which is appropriate for a knife. A Crit rating of 3 is  what we consider our “average” Crit value. Rolling   󲊴  󲊴   󲊴   on a check is not too unlikely for a skilled user.  And because this is a close combat weapon, it can only  be used against enemies your character is engaged with  (hence the range of “engaged”).  A knife is small, so we gave it an encumbrance value  of 1. A knife is cheap and easy to find, hence the inex -  pensive price and low rarity. It also has no special item  qualities, because again, it’s a simple knife.  r evolver  This is our profile for a standard revolver. Like the knife’s,  this profile is general enough that it could work for a six-  shooter out of the 1800s, a sidearm in a steampunk uni -  verse, or something straight out of our own era.  The weapon is a Ranged weapon, hence it uses the  Ranged skill. Of course, if your setting breaks up  Ranged into multiple skills, this would probably use  Ranged (Light) since it’s a pistol used in one hand. The  damage reflects this: good damage for a pistol, but not  comparable to a military rifle’s. The same goes for the  Crit rating. Rolling   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   on a check is a bit less  likely, so it’s going to take a skilled shot to make this  weapon effective. We gave this a range of medium,  which is typically the maximum range for pistols (some  pistols are only useful at short range).  The weapon’s a bit bigger and bulkier than the knife,  hence the higher encumbrance value of 2. Its cost  reflects the higher cost of firearms, but it should still  be fairly easy to find one. It also has one item quality,  since revolvers tend to be accurate sidearms.  You may be surprised that we didn’t  give it the Limited Ammo 6 quality  (for its six shots). However, we find in  games that combat encounters tend to  average around three to five rounds.  If a weapon is unlikely to run out of  ammo before combat ends, we recom -  mend that it’s not worth tracking ammo  and that you should use the rules in the   Track -  ing Ammo   sidebar on page   89 .

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 92  a r M or  N ow that we’ve talked about weapons, let’s cover  armor briefly. What form armor takes in your  game is going to depend a lot on the setting. How -  ever, mechanically, all forms of armor work the same,  whether medieval plate mail or modern ballistic armor.  For our purposes, armor is pretty much anything that  your character wears to increase their protection. If  your game involves combat, we expect that your char -  acter wears some sort of armor. We should emphasize  that the game is designed with that conceit in mind,  so if your character is getting into fights without any  armor, they are taking on more of a risk.  For that reason, we keep our definition of  “armor” really broad. Not everyone is going to  want their character to be wearing the bulki -  est body armor available all the time (after all,  most action movie heroes don’t!) So, in our  game, even a heavy leather jacket or sturdy  clothing   provides   some   protection.   Often,  that’s all your character is really going to need,  and narratively, it still looks like something they  might wear every day.  Your character can only benefit from wearing one  piece of armor. Even if they wear two or more pieces  of armor, you have to choose which one improves soak  and defense and provides any unique benefits.  a rmor   c haracteristics  Every piece of armor is defined through the following  characteristics. Armor also shares some characteristic  categories with weapons, notably price and rarity. The  descriptions of these characteristics can be found on  page   90 .  D   efense  The armor’s   defense adds   󲊸   equal to the defense rat -  ing directly to the attacker’s dice pool. This reflects  the armor’s ability to deflect damage away from the  wearer’s body.  The defense rating of armor sets the user’s defense  at a certain value, while other abilities and talents may  then increase the user’s defense rating.  s oak  A suit of armor’s   soak is added to the wearer’s soak  value and you subtract the total soak from any dam -  age suffered. If an attack causes 10 damage, for exam -  ple, a soak of 2 plus a Brawn of 2 reduces the damage  incurred by four, leaving a total of six points of damage.  Most armor adds +1 or +2 soak, rarely more.  e ncumbrance  Each full suit or discrete piece of armor has a listed  encumbrance value. However, armor’s   full   encum -  brance rating only comes into play when a suit or piece  of armor is carried instead of worn. When armor is  worn, its encumbrance rating is reduced by three, to a  minimum of zero.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 93  a r M or   d es C riptions  H ere we’ve included one piece of armor, the heavy  jacket. As we mentioned at the beginning of the  chapter, we’re not going to include an extensive list  of armor in this section, since armor depends a great  deal on the setting you’re playing in. This, however,  is basic enough that it lets us get an overview of how  armor works.  You’ll also notice that, as we talked about in the  beginning of the   Armor   section, this “armor” is some -  thing your character could wear in most situations  without anyone finding it odd.  Normally, we present the armor entries in a series of  paragraphs with headers. We also present their char -  acteristics in a single, consolidated table to save space.  h eavy   j acket  This is our profile for the heavy jacket. This is general  enough to represent a piece of clothing that would fit  into a number of eras.  The jacket has no defense, because it has no elements  that would deflect a blow. It adds +1 soak to your char -  acter, which is in line with heavy clothing, but not at the  level of military or police armor. The price is what you’d  expect to pay for a rugged, well-made jacket. It also isn’t a  problem to carry (remember that when the jacket’s worn,  that encumbrance drops down to 0). However, besides  cosmetic customizations, a jacket doesn’t do much, so  there aren’t any other special rules. Finally, jackets are  really easy to find, leading to the low rarity.  g ear  G ear is our catchall term for anything that isn’t weap -  ons or armor. Generally,   gear needs fewer rules  than either of those, so we can lump everything together  in this third category.  In   Part II: Settings , we often split gear into subcat -  egories, depending on the type. These subcategories  may   include   communications   equipment,   medical  equipment, tools, or survival gear. However, these sub -  categories exist just for organization.  G ear   c haracteristics  Unlike the host of characteristics that come with armor  and weapons, only three describe gear: price, encum -  brance, and rarity. All three work exactly the same as  we’ve described in the weapon section, on page   90 .  t he   r i G ht   t ool   for   the   j ob  Besides their characteristics, most pieces of gear have just  one rule. It’s a rule we like to call “the right tool for the job.”  The rule is this: Due to the narrative-driven nature  of our game, not every piece of equipment grants a  unique rule or bonus to gameplay mechanics. Instead,  most pieces of gear assist your character in perform -  ing tasks they might not be able to accomplish with -  out them. A pair of binoculars allow your character  to spot foes from a long way away, for example; a cell  phone lets you communicate over long distances, and  a camp stove lets your character cook food in the wil -  derness. In these cases, your character’s equipment  makes a task possible. The gear doesn’t grant any  additional bonus in the rules; it just lets your charac -  ter do something they normally couldn’t.  At other times, a piece of gear helps your character  do something better. For example, a compass may not  be vital to successfully following a trail through the  woods, but it probably would be useful. Likewise, a  propane lantern would be helpful in starting a larger  fire, since it has a fuel source and igniter. Whenever a  character uses a piece of gear to aid in a task that the  character could still normally perform without the  equipment, you and the GM can agree to add   󲊸   to  the dice pool.  That’s what we mean by the right tool for the job. The  whole thing is a bit of a judgement call for you and your  GM, but as is the case in most of these situations, the  GM has the final say.  u ni Q ue   r ules  Other pieces of gear have rules unique to that item  described in the item’s entry. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 94  g ear   d es C riptions  H ere we’ve included three pieces of gear: a backpack,  rope, and a painkiller. Again, we’re not including a  longer or more specific list of gear, because what gear is  available depends a lot on the setting. However, this sec -  tion should give you an idea of how gear works.  Normally, we present gear entries in a series of para -  graphs with headers. We then present their character -  istics in a single, consolidated table to save space, just  as with weapons and armor.  b ackpack  This is a profile for a backpack. Backpacks can take a  lot of different forms, but the basics of how one works  remains the same. Backpacks vary in price and rarity, and  they have one unique rule that lets characters carry more.  While wearing a backpack, your character increases  their encumbrance threshold by four.  p ainkiller  This is the profile for a   painkiller, which is the generic  term we use for a consumable, quick-healing item.  Being able to quickly heal a number of wounds is  important to the system; it lets you keep your charac -  ter moving when they would otherwise be eliminated,  and it tempers the lethality of combat. Although these  items mechanically heal wounds, thematically they  can help your character get back on their feet in any  number of ways, depending on the setting. In a   fantasy  setting, these may be   healing potions   that use magic to  heal injuries. In the   steampunk   setting, they may be  healing tonics   that rely on some ill-understood scien -  tific or alchemical properties. The   weird war   setting  can use   aid packs   that are either scientific or magical.  A   modern day   setting treats these as   painkillers , allow -  ing your character to ignore minor injuries and keep  going.   Science fiction   or   space opera   settings could  also use painkillers, or they could use   autohealers   that  rely on futuristic medicine or even nanotechnology  to patch up injuries in moments.  Whatever the name, painkillers work the same  way in the game mechanics for every setting.  Using a painkiller requires one maneuver for  your character to apply it either to themself or  to another engaged character. The painkiller  is consumed in the process, and the character  immediately heals 5 wounds. While a character can  use multiple painkillers, this provides diminishing  returns. Each painkiller after the first heals one wound  fewer. A second painkiller heals 4 wounds, a third  heals 3, and so on. Using a sixth painkiller in a day  has no further effect.  After one day, the lingering effects of the painkillers  wear off, and the character may use painkillers again  with their normal effect (this means a character can  consume up to five painkillers a day, each day). See page  116   for more information on painkillers and healing.  r ope  This is a profile for a length of rope: maybe a coil of  woven hemp, or maybe a high-tech nylon climbing rope.  Rope doesn’t come with any unique rules. The only rule  associated with it is that often it is  the right tool for the job.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 95  CHAPTER 6: COMBAT ENCOUNTERS  A t some point in nearly every roleplaying game, the  time for discussion is over, and it’s time for your  characters to roll up their sleeves and kick some butt.  Although it doesn’t have to be, we expect combat to be a  part of many of your games, and this chapter discusses  how to make combat encounters happen.  n arrative   and   s tru C tured   g a M eplay  W e expect most of the gameplay in   Genesys   to be  done on a narrative basis, with your GM describ -  ing events and you and your fellow players describing your  characters’ actions and reactions to those events. Combat,  however, requires more structured gameplay rules.  Narrative gameplay does not require the GM or play -  ers to keep track of the exact passage of time, and for  the most part, this is perfectly acceptable. It’s usually  enough to know that actions may take a few minutes,  hours, days, or weeks (or any other amount of time).  Narrative gameplay is most often used in situations for  which the precise order of actions is unimportant.  Conversely, structured gameplay is, at its heart, a  rules system that breaks up a character’s actions into  what they could reasonably perform in a predeter -  mined amount of time. It also gives each character in  a scene the opportunity to perform actions in turn. It’s  most often used for playing through combat situations.  However, your GM may decide to employ structured  gameplay in certain non-combat scenes that they feel  would benefit from requiring the players to clearly  define their characters’ actions within a rule set.  s tructure D   Gameplay   o vervie W  When   using   structured   gameplay   to   describe   the  sequence of events during a firefight, rapier duel, or hec -  tic chase through busy streets, we break the game down  into a series of rounds, each of which is further broken  down into a series of turns. During a single round, each  player character and non-player character gets one  turn, during which that character has the opportunity  to accomplish tasks and perform various actions.  Rounds can represent roughly a minute or so in  time, although we’ve deliberately avoided specifying  the elapsed time amount. You should keep in mind  that a round lasts long enough for your character to  move to a new location and perform an important  C ool   or   v igilan C e ?  Two different skills in   Genesys   can be used to  determine   Initiative: Cool and Vigilance. The  situation at hand determines which skill should  be used in a particular circumstance.  Characters   should   determine   their   Initiative  using the Cool skill when they are aware and  ready for combat (or for whatever situation has  resulted in the use of structured gameplay).  For example, rolling to see who goes first in a  quick-draw gunfight or springing an ambush on  an unsuspecting enemy would require Cool, as  Cool represents a character’s ability to remain  calm, collected, and focused on the task ahead.  Characters   should   determine   their   Initiative  using the Vigilance skill when combat (or another  situation resulting in structured gameplay) begins  unexpectedly. Two enemies walking around a  corner and running into each other would each  use Vigilance to determine Initiative, for example.  Likewise, someone being ambushed would also  use Vigilance to determine Initiative (and if they  ended up going earlier in the Initiative order than  their ambusher, clearly they were vigilant enough  to spot the ambush at the last second).  It’s important to note that different characters  may use different skills to determine Initiative  during the same combat, depending on their  differing circumstances. Also, if you and your  GM are unsure which of the two skills best  applies to a given situation, you should default  to using Vigilance. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 96  action. You should also remember that although each  round is broken up into turns that happen sequen -  tially in gameplay, narratively the turns are occurring  at roughly the same time.  Structured gameplay events (also called encounters),  such as combat, follow these steps:  s tep   1: D   etermine   i nitiative  At the beginning of the first round of combat, all play -  ers and the GM need to determine in what order the  characters take their turns. Do the soldiers ambush the  supply column, or does the hidden sniper get in the  first shot? This is referred to as the Initiative order.  To determine the Initiative order, each player char -  acter and NPC makes a   Simple (–) Cool   or   Vigilance  check   (for more information on which to use, see the  Cool or Vigilance?   sidebar on page   95 ). Once all  Initiative checks have been made, the GM notes the  results of each check and ranks them in order from  the highest number of   󲊳   to the lowest. If two checks  are tied, the check with more   󲊴   is ranked higher. If a  player character and an NPC are still tied, the player  character is ranked higher. This is the Initiative order.  s tep   2:   a ssi G n   i nitiative   s lots  Once the GM has determined the Initiative order, they  note which results were generated by player characters  and which results were generated by NPCs. The results  generated by player characters become player character  Initiative slots. The results generated by NPCs become  NPC Initiative slots.  s tep   3:   p articipants   t ake   t urns  Beginning at the top of the Initiative order, the play -  ers and GM fill each Initiative slot one at a time with a  character turn. If the Initiative slot is a player charac -  ter Initiative slot, then the players agree on one player  character to fill the slot from among the player char -  acters who have not acted yet this round. That player  character then takes this turn. While taking their turn,  we refer to this character as the   active character .  If the Initiative slot is an NPC Initiative slot, then the  GM chooses one NPC to fill the slot from among the  NPCs who have not yet acted this round. That NPC  then takes this turn.  s tep   4:   r oun D   e n D s  Once all NPCs and player characters have taken a turn,  the round ends. At this point, certain effects that last  until the “end of the round” may end. The GM also  determines if the ongoing encounter warrants addi -  tional rounds or if it has been resolved. If the ongoing  events continue, repeat step 3 using the same Initia -  tive order generated in step 1. If the action has been  resolved and the encounter is over, proceed to step 5.  s tep   5:   e ncounter   e n D s  Once the action has been resolved, the GM ends the  encounter. At this point, any character abilities that may  only be used “once per encounter” are again available,  and any abilities that last “until the end of the encounter”  expire. Player characters also have a chance to catch their  breath and recover from strain (see page   117 ), and they  may take steps to help heal any incapacitated characters.  t he   t urn  Each character (whether a player character or a non-  player character) gets one turn to act during each round.  During their turn, the character can do any of a number of  things, such as dash for cover, attempt to unlock a sealed  door, or shoot a pistol at an opponent. The activities the  character can perform during their turn are split into  three categories: incidentals, maneuvers, and actions.  i nci D entals  Incidentals are minor activities characters can under -  take that require extremely little time or effort. Drop -  ping a broken radio, speaking to a friend, or switching  on a stun baton are all incidentals. There is no hard  limit to the number of incidentals a character may per -  form during their turn, although your GM may veto  C ine M ati C   C o M bat  Genesys   strives to capture the pure cinematic  thrill found in some of the best action and adven -  ture books, movies, and other media. Combat is  frequent and fast-moving, and meant to show -  case the talents and abilities of the characters.  The unique dice system of   Genesys   helps fuel  the story-driven nature of the game. Even a single  attack roll generates enough options (some good,  some bad) to give your Game Master sufficient  information to make combat far more than just  a matter of rolling to hit and rolling to wound. In  turn, we strongly encourage you to provide inter -  esting detail before rolling on an attack, in order  to give your GM ideas for describing the results.  Combat is streamlined so the players do not bog  down gameplay with too many tactical decisions;  descriptions of their actions and the roll of the  dice is sufficient to help visualize the violence. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 97  excessive numbers of them or decide they are complex  enough to warrant counting as a maneuver. The follow -  ing are examples of incidentals:  •   Speaking to another character.  •   Dropping an item held in one’s hands.  •   Releasing someone the character is holding.  •   Minor movements such as shifting position, peek -  ing around a corner, or looking behind oneself.  m aneuvers  Maneuvers are activities that aren’t complex enough to  warrant a skill check, but still involve time and effort  on the part of a character. Characters are allowed one  maneuver during their turn, and certain circumstances  may allow them a second maneuver as well (see page  98 ). The following are some examples of maneuvers:  •   Aiming a weapon.  •   Moving one range band closer or farther away from  an enemy (for more on range bands, see page   105 ).  •   Opening a door.  •   Diving behind cover.  •   Standing up.  a ctions  Actions are important activities that are vital to a char -  acter’s accomplishment of a goal. Each character may  normally only perform one action during their turn,  likely the most important activity they undertake dur -  ing their turn. Actions almost always involve perform -  ing a skill check, although certain character abilities  may require using an action to activate them. The fol -  lowing are some examples of actions:  •   Hacking a computer.  •   Unlocking a locked door.  •   Firing a weapon.  •   Punching or grappling an opponent.  •   Instructing allies with a series of orders.  •   Performing first aid on an ally.  •   Sneaking up on a vigilant foe.  •   Climbing a cliff.  Out of all of these options, the most common during  combat are those that involve attacking an opponent.  Attacking an opponent requires a combat skill check,  sometimes referred to in shorthand as a combat check  or simply an attack.  i n C identals  I ncidentals are anything a character wants to do that  takes very little time, or has no measurable effect  on the ongoing encounter. This includes dropping  something they’re holding, letting go of someone, say -  ing something, looking around, gesturing, or making  other minor movements. We have no exhaustive list  of possible incidentals, because the possibilities for  what a character can do as an incidental are so varied,  and because, like we said, most of them don’t have any  mechanical effect.  Although we have not created a hard limit on how many  incidentals a character can perform during combat, we  encourage players to limit the incidentals their character  performs during each turn to a few simple things. If they  don’t, the GM is always free to tell players that the amount  of stuff they want their character to do is complex enough  that it requires a maneuver, or even an action.  One other note: generally when it isn’t a character’s  turn, an incidental is all they can perform. There are  some exceptions, but these are clearly noted in the rules.  M aneuvers  J ust as   Genesys   uses an abstract method of describ -  ing combat, we similarly describe movement in broad  strokes. Characters often do far more than shooting or  swinging weapons in combat, like pulling out medical  supplies to heal a wounded comrade, activating the sys -  tems to open a door, or scaling a wall to gain an advan -  tage over their opponents.  Not all undertakings require a check. These minor  activities, known as   maneuvers, cover a wide range of  activities that any character can perform. They require  an investment of time and effort on the character’s part,  but they are simple enough that there is no chance of  failure when doing them. Technically, characters per -  form maneuvers during narrative gameplay as well as Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 98  during structured gameplay, or encounters. However,  maneuvers are tracked and defined during encounters,  because characters’ time and efforts are more limited  by the frantic pace of conflict.  m aneuver   l imitations  Whether taking careful aim at an enemy, diving for  cover behind a stack of cargo crates, or patching up  a wounded friend, a character may perform one free  maneuver on their turn. They may perform a sec -  ond maneuver by voluntarily suffering two points of  strain, thereby stretching themself to their limits in  order to get more done. Characters may also perform  a second maneuver through a particularly success -  ful skill check (by spending   󲊴   󲊴   generated on that  check), or by other means listed elsewhere. However,  regardless of the source, a single character may not  perform more than two maneuvers during their turn.  m aneuvers   o utsi D e   a   c haracter   ’   s   t urn  In some cases, a character may be able to perform a  maneuver when it’s not that character’s turn. An enemy  soldier rolling horribly on a Stealth check to ambush a  PC may generate a number of   󲊱   on their check. The  GM may decide that the blunder allows the would-be  victim the opportunity to perform a maneuver, even  though it’s the soldier’s turn.  Any bonus maneuvers gained outside of a char -  acter’s turn do not count toward the limit of two  maneuvers a character may perform during their  turn—specifically because they occur outside of the  character’s turn. These additional maneuvers are gen -  erally awarded at the Game Master’s discretion, and  thus there is no hard-and-fast limit to the number  of maneuvers that can be awarded in this manner.  However, we encourage GMs to limit the number of  out-of-turn maneuvers any character performs each  round to one or two at most.  t ypes   of   m aneuvers  The following is a list of the maneuvers a character  can perform during combat. Please note that this list  is not exhaustive. The entire point of maneuvers is  that they can cover any activity that is relatively easy  to perform but still requires some amount of time and  effort. While the maneuvers listed here are deliber -  ately general to cover as many options as possible, if a  player comes up with something they want their char -  acter to do that is not covered by this list, they should  not dismiss the idea out of hand. Instead, they should  explain what they’d like to accomplish to the GM,  who can decide if it can realistically be performed in  a single maneuver.  Some activities may require multiple maneuvers to  perform. Generally, these maneuvers must be per -  formed sequentially, without being interrupted by the  character performing other maneuvers or actions, for  the task to be successful.  a im  During combat, a character can use the aim maneu -  ver to steady a weapon or line up a hit before attack -  ing, which grants a bonus to their next combat check.  A character only gains the benefit of aiming if they  remain in their current position and do not perform  any additional maneuvers or actions before their next  combat check. Any damage taken that exceeds the  character’s soak also negates the benefit of aiming.  Aiming provides the character with one of the fol -  lowing two bonuses:  •   Gain   󲊸   on the next combat check. If the character  spends two consecutive maneuvers aiming, they  gain   󲊸   󲊸   on the next combat check.  •   Target a specific item carried by the opponent or a  specific part of the target or opponent. This could  allow the character to attempt to strike or shoot a  weapon from an opponent’s hand, for example, or  target an opponent’s limb to hobble them. If the  character spends one maneuver aiming to do this,  their next combat check suffers   󲊸   󲊸 . If they spend  two consecutive maneuvers aiming, the combat  check suffers   󲊸   instead.  a ssist  Whether a character is trying to get a truck engine up  and running or is using a first aid kit on a wounded  comrade, it never hurts to have a little bit of help. Per -  forming the assist maneuver allows an engaged ally  to add   󲊸   to their next check. Several characters can  use the assist maneuver to add more bonus   󲊸   to the  engaged ally’s next check. All awarded bonus dice must  be used on the assisted character’s next turn; otherwise,  they are discarded.  The Game Master should use their own discretion  when allowing characters to assist one another. Some  actions simply do not benefit from assistance. Likewise,  it is up to the GM as to how many characters can real -  istically assist another character. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

G   uar D e D   s tance  When a character is confronted by an angry enemy with  a weapon, they may be inclined to defend themselves  rather than taking an ineffectual swing at their opponent.  In such an instance, the character can take a maneuver  to assume a guarded stance, which contributes to their  defense against melee attacks. A character who performs  this maneuver adds   󲊸   to any combat checks they make  until the end of their next turn. However, they also gain  melee defense 1 until the end of their next turn.  i nteract   W ith   the   e nvironment  Often, a single maneuver is enough to interact with the  environment around a character. This is a broad cat -  egory of possible interactions, such as opening a door,  ducking behind a wall, pressing a specific button on a  control panel, or grabbing a weapon off of the ground.  The   following   are   additional   specifically   designed  examples of interacting with the environment:  •   Moving a large item.   Flipping over a table, shov -  ing a barrel into a pursuer’s path, hefting a crate:  each of these takes a maneuver to perform.  •   Opening or closing a door.   Whether an electronic  blast door or a simple door with latches and hinges,  opening or closing it takes a maneuver.  •   Taking cover.   Ducking behind a door jamb,  crouching   behind   a   crate,   or   peeking  around a tree trunk: all of these allow  the character to gain ranged defense  1 (some cover can grant a ranged  defense higher than 1, if particu -  larly sturdy). It takes a maneuver  to take cover, but once in cover,  the character keeps the bonus  unless   the   circumstances  around   them   change   such  that they no longer benefit  from cover, or they move out  of cover.  m ana G e   G   ear  Managing items and equipment  is accomplished by this maneu -  ver, which can cover the follow -  ing options:  •   Draw, holster, ready, or load  a   weapon.   This   maneuver  covers   the   basic   manipula -  tions of most weapons, such  as drawing a longsword from  its sheath, reloading a laser rifle’s energy cells  (provided the character has additional ammo at  hand—see page   89 ), or drawing and arming a  fragmentation grenade for use.  •   Draw something from storage or put it away.   A  character can perform a maneuver to retrieve an  item from a pouch, backpack, satchel, bandolier,  or some other accessible container. This maneuver  can also be used to stow items in a similar fashion.  m ount   or   D   ismount  Across the many settings in   Genesys , characters com -  monly use beasts of burden to get from place to place.  Mounting or dismounting from a domesticated animal,  such as a trained horse, requires a maneuver. (Success -  fully mounting an untrained animal, however, requires  an   Average [ 󲊷   󲊷 ] Survival check   and thus an action,  which could be made harder depending on how ornery  the GM feels the animal is.) Similarly, entering a vehi -  cle, sliding into a cockpit, or otherwise taking position  to pilot a vehicle, crew a gunnery station, or the like  requires a maneuver as well.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 100  m ove  One of the most important maneuvers a character can  make is to move—from one piece of cover to the next,  to a wounded ally’s side, away from the claws of a vicious  bear, or out of range of an enemy’s crossbow. The game  defines several different broad types of movement.  When characters move, they do one of the following:  •   Change range increment.   Performing this maneu -  ver allows a character to move between short and  medium range relative to another person or object.  Performing two move maneuvers allows a charac -  ter to move between medium and long range or  between long and extreme range. When covering  long distances, multiple maneuvers do not have to  be performed on the same turn, but the character  is not considered to be in the new range increment  until all required maneuvers have been performed.  For more detail on determining range, see   Range  Bands , page   105 .  •   Engage or disengage from an opponent.   If a tar -  get is already within short range of a character, the  character can perform a maneuver to engage that  target. If the character is engaged with an opponent  or adversary, they must perform a maneuver to dis -  engage from that opponent before moving to any  other location. This only changes their range relative  to their opponent from engaged to short and repre -  sents the effort of backing away and avoiding their  opponent’s attacks. Characters do not need to per -  form this maneuver to leave an engagement consist -  ing only of friendly characters or allies.  •   Move within short range.   Performing this maneu -  ver allows an unengaged character to move to  another position that is currently within short  range of them.  D   rop   p rone   or   s tan D   from   p rone  Dropping prone and standing from a prone position  each requires a maneuver. Dropping prone allows the  character to add   󲊸   to all ranged attacks made against  them, although they also must add   󲊸   to all melee  attacks made against them.  p reparation  Some actions require additional preparation to perform  safely or effectively. The preparation maneuver is gener -  ally performed in conjunction with another ability to  confer a bonus, offset a penalty, or fulfill a requirement.  The individual talents and abilities that utilize the prepa -  ration maneuver define its specific effect. It is sometimes  abbreviated under the requirements as “prepare.”  f lying  Flight in   Genesys   is handled in two different  ways. Vehicles and starships that fly use the rules  found in   Part III: Game Master Toolkit , page  220 , to handle their flight. Some pieces of equip -  ment allow individuals to mimic such flight and  use these rules as well.  However, some creatures and individuals can fly, but  not at the same speeds as vehicles. In these cases, the  creatures or individuals simply move from one place  to the other by flying, but still use the rules presented  in this chapter for situations such as combat. Their  flight is handled mostly narratively, with a common-  sense approach. For example, a flying creature could  easily fly over difficult or impassable terrain, or fly  over water without having to swim. It could cover  vertical distances in the same way that individu -  als cover horizontal ones. However, there are some  points to keep in mind concerning flying creatures.  Creatures and species that can hover rely on swiftly  moving wings, bags of lighter-than-air gas, or other  systems to move while staying above the ground.  This type of movement follows the same game  rules as those for other creatures, with the follow -  ing exceptions: hovering creatures ignore difficult  or impassable terrain as long as they can reasonably  stay above it, and they ignore the penalties for mov -  ing through water. They generally have to stay rela -  tively close to the ground (within medium range)  unless noted otherwise.  Creatures that can fly (such as most birds) use aero -  dynamic principles such as lift to stay aloft. These  follow all the same rules concerning terrain as crea -  tures that hover. However, they have to maintain at  least some speed to stay aloft, and thus while flying  must spend one maneuver every turn to move (they  can actually change position, or just circle or wheel  in place and effectively remain where they are).  Most flying creatures can move faster than hover -  ing or ground creatures, and they can move from  long range to short range using a single maneuver. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 101  a C tions  D uring a character’s turn, they generally have the  chance to perform one primary activity. This is the  character’s action. Actions include any activity complex  enough to warrant a skill check, such as slicing into a com -  puter network, firing a rifle, or leaping across a chasm.  a ction   l imitations  A character may only perform one action in a turn. Some  characters may have abilities allowing them to perform an  action as a maneuver. This does not violate the limit of one  action per turn, as the action now counts as a maneuver.  t ypes   of   a ctions  There are four major types of actions a character can  perform during their turn: exchanging an action for  a maneuver, spending the action to activate an ability  or talent, performing a skill check, and performing a  combat check. The last, performing a combat check, is  actually a variation on performing a skill check. How -  ever, enough unique circumstances surround it that it  requires its own entry.  e xchan G e   an   a ction   for   a   m aneuver  A character may exchange their action for an additional  maneuver during their turn. They may then perform any  maneuver they would be able to perform normally, fol -  lowing all the rules that govern maneuvers. However, they  still may not perform more than two maneuvers during  their turn, no matter how they gained access to them.  s pen D   an   a ction   to   a ctivate   an   a bility  Certain abilities and talents require an action to acti -  vate. When a character spends an action to activate an  ability or talent (even if spending the action does not  require a check or any other activity on the character’s  part), they have used their action for their turn. They  may not take a second action unless they specifically  have an ability that grants them a second action.  p erform   a   s kill   c heck  The most common actions that most characters take  during their turns are actions that require a skill check  to resolve. In other words, these are activities for which  success is not guaranteed or for which the failure of  the task may be important to the ongoing story. For  example, for most characters, walking from one place  to another does not bring with it any inherent risk of  failure. Characters who have no relevant injuries or dis -  abilities are assumed to be able to walking from one  location to another. Even if a character could fail, fail -  ing would not significantly change the ongoing story.  However, trying to cross a chasm on a tightrope to  escape pursuit brings an inherent risk of failure (falling  and possibly dying), and failing can advance the story  (whether or not the character escapes pursuit). There -  fore, a Coordination check is called for, and if it occurs  during an encounter, it requires an action to perform.  Most skill checks and what they can accomplish are  covered in   Chapter 3: Skills . What a character can do  with a skill outside of an encounter is the same as what  they can do with it inside of an encounter. The only  difference is that inside an encounter, they have cer -  tain time limits imposed. In fact, the GM can deter -  mine that certain activities may require more than one  action to perform, if they would normally take a great  deal of time. (If the activity is time-consuming enough  that it cannot be performed while the encounter con -  tinues, the GM may require the character to wait for  the encounter to end before attempting the activity.)  Combat checks, however, are unique enough that  they require a separate description.  p erform   a   c ombat   c heck  A PC makes a   combat check when they use a combat  skill to attack a target—by firing a gun, throwing a  punch, or swinging a sword, for example. This is also  referred to as an attack.  First and foremost, keep in mind that a combat check  is a skill check. It follows all of the rules and procedures  for making a skill check, including the steps for assem -  bling the dice pool. However, there are additional steps  included in a combat check. All the steps a combat  check follows are detailed here.  s tep   1. D   eclare   an   a ttack   an D   s elect   t ar G ets  The character chooses to make an attack. They select  what skill they use to make the attack and, if the skill  requires a weapon to use, which weapon they use.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 102  abilities. Certain conditions, such as the painful effect of  a Critical Injury or an environmental effect such as fog or  darkness, may also contribute dice to the dice pool. See  page   19   for more information on building a dice pool.  The difficulty of a combat check depends on whether  the attack is a ranged attack (using the Ranged skill or  one of its derivatives, depending on the setting) or a  melee attack (using the Brawl or Melee skill or a set -  ting-dependent derivative). Melee attack difficulties  are always   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) . Ranged attack difficulties  depend on the distance the target is from the active  character, or in other words, the range band the target  occupies.   Table I.6–1: Ranged Attack Difficulties   lists  difficulties as they relate to different range bands. (See  page   105   for more information about range bands.)  Once the pool is assembled, roll the dice.  s tep   3.   p ool   r esults   an D   D   eal   D   ama G e  Once the player rolls the dice pool for the attack,  the player evaluates the results. As with any skill  check, the check must generate more   󲊳   than  󲊰   to be successful.  When making a combat check, if the check  is successful, each   󲊳   adds +1 damage to  the attack. If the attack affects multiple targets, the addi -  tional damage is added to each target.  s tep   4.   r esolve   󲊴   an D   󲊵  Just as they can be spent in a non-combat skill check,   󲊴  and   󲊵   can be spent in a combat check to gain inciden -  tal beneficial effects. However, just as the rules governing  encounters are somewhat more regimented than the rules  governing narrative gameplay, so some of the options gov -  erning the spending of   󲊴   and   󲊵   are more clearly defined.  In encounters, the player controlling the active character  determines how the character spends   󲊴   and   󲊵 , unless  the GM has a specific reason to decide instead.  The first and foremost ways to spend   󲊴   and   󲊵  in an attack are to activate a Critical Injury or active  item quality. As described on page   90 , each weapon  has a Critical rating that consists of a numeric value.  The user can spend that many   󲊴   to inflict one Criti -  cal Injury on the target, in addition to regular effects  and damage. Remember, a Critical Injury can only be  triggered upon a successful hit that deals damage that  exceeds the target’s soak value. For more information  on Critical Injuries, see page   114 .  Item qualities are special effects and abilities that  apply only when a character is using that particular  weapon—the vicious edge of a sword, say, or  the automatic fire capability of a heavy  machine gun. Item qualities come  in two forms: active and passive.  Active qualities require the user  to spend a certain number of   󲊴  to trigger them. Generally, this  is   󲊴   󲊴 , although some quali -  ties may require more or fewer.  Passive qualities always grant  their effect. Some qualities may  inflict effects on a target that,  unless specified otherwise, are  always applied in addition to  other effects, Critical Injuries,  and damage.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 103  In addition to always counting as an additional   󲊳 ,   󲊵  can be spent to activate item qualities as well. A   󲊵   may  be spent to inflict one Critical Injury (no matter what  the Critical rating of the weapon is). Alternatively, a   󲊵  may be spent to activate one item quality, no matter  how many   󲊴   it would normally take to do so.  There are other options for spending   󲊴   and   󲊵   as  well. A list of the most common can be found on   Table  I.6–2: Spending   󲊴   and   󲊵   in Combat , on page   104 .  Keep in mind that these are not intended to be the only  options available. As always, players and GMs may  invent other ways to spend   󲊴   and   󲊵 , depending on  the specific circumstances of the encounter. Any option  that the players and GM agree upon can be viable.  s tep   5.   r esolve   󲊱   an D   󲊲  In the same fashion in which the controlling player  determines how to spend   󲊴   and   󲊵   in their combat  check, the GM then determines how to spend any   󲊱  or   󲊲   generated in the check. Much as fortune might  favor the player, bad luck and circumstance can con -  spire against them. By default, the GM determines how  󲊱   and   󲊲   are spent, although in some cases (such as  checks made by NPCs) they may give the players the  option to spend these instead.  Although many weapon descriptions include options  for spending   󲊴   and   󲊵 , most do not for   󲊱   and   󲊲 ;  however, this is not always the case. Some particularly  volatile or dangerous weapons do have these options,  and if they do, the options are detailed in the weapon’s  description. Specific options for spending   󲊱   and   󲊲   in  encounters do exist, however, and the most common  of these can be found on   Table I.6–3: Spending   󲊱  and   󲊲   in Combat , on page   104 . As with   󲊴   and   󲊵 ,  keep in mind that these are not intended to be the only  options available. As always, GMs may invent other  ways to spend   󲊱   and   󲊲 , depending on the specific  circumstances of the encounter, and any option that  the players and GM agree on can be viable.  s tep   6.   r e D uce   D   ama G e   ,   a pply   to   W   oun D   t hreshol D ,  an D   a pply   c ritical   i njuries  When a character suffers damage, whether from a rifle  or claws, they reduce the damage received by their  soak value. If any damage remains after this reduc -  tion, they suffer that many wounds. If the net result  is zero or negative, the character suffers no wounds;  their toughness and natural fortitude, in conjunction  with any armor they might be wearing, have saved  them from being injured. If the character suffers dam -  age from multiple hits in an attack, they apply their  soak value to each hit individually. For more infor -  mation on damage and wounds, see   Wounds, Strain,  and States of Health , on page   112 .  An attack may also generate a Critical Injury. This  may occur because the weapon’s Critical rating is trig -  gered, or because the target suffers a number of wounds  greater than its wound threshold. More about Critical  ratings is explained in   Step 4: Resolve   󲊴   and   󲊵 .  When a Critical Injury is inflicted, the attacker rolls  percentile dice on   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result ,  on page   115 . The result of the dice roll indicates which  Critical Injury is inflicted.  Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Injury  roll, potentially making it more or less effective. If an  attack generates enough   󲊴   to trigger more than one  Critical Injury, the character makes a single Critical  Injury roll, adding +10 to the result for each additional  time the Critical rating is triggered.  r anged   a tta C ks   and   M elee   a tta C ks  Ranged attacks and melee attacks are two dif -  ferent types of attacks, meaning they are also  two different types of combat checks. A ranged  attack is an attack made with a ranged weapon of  some sort, most likely using the Ranged skill (or  one of its variants). A melee attack is an attack  made in close combat with an opponent, and  with a weapon designed for use in close combat.  Such an attack is most likely to be made using  the Brawl or Melee skill (or one of its variants).  o ther   s kills   in   C o M bat  Although the core rules only have three combat  skills, we know that your game is likely going  to include more (depending on the setting, or  your own invention). In addition, you may have  invented your own combat skills.  The most important thing to know about those  skills is whether they are used to make ranged  attacks or close combat attacks. This deter -  mines how you use those skills when making a  combat check. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 104  d efense  D efense, or specifically, defense rating, is one of the  factors determining how difficult it is to land a suc -  cessful attack during combat. Defense ratings represent  the abilities of shields, armor, or other defenses to deflect  attacks entirely, or to absorb or lessen incoming blows.  A character adds a number of   󲊸   equal to their defense  rating to all combat checks directed against them.  No character can have a   defense rating higher  than 4.

When dealing damage to a target, have the attack disable the opponent or one piece of gear rather than dealing wounds or strain.  This could include hobbling them temporarily with a shot to the leg, or disabling their radio. This should be agreed upon by the  player and the GM, and the effects are up to the GM (although   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result , on page   115 , is a good  resource to consult for possible effects).

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 105  m elee   an D   r an G e D   D efense  A character’s defense rating can be classified as one of  three types: general defense rating, melee defense rat -  ing, or   ranged defense rating. A general defense rat -  ing applies against all combat checks directed against  the character. A   melee defense rating only applies  against close combat checks directed against the char -  acter (Brawl, Melee, Melee [Light], and Melee [Heavy]  checks). A ranged defense rating only applies against  ranged combat checks directed against the charac -  ter (Gunnery, Ranged, Ranged [Light], and Ranged  [Heavy] checks).  There are two sources of defense: sources that  stack, and sources that do not stack. You can think  of this as sources that   provide   defense, and sources  that   increase   defense.  Sources that provide defense (such as most armor)  list the defense provided as a number, or say that they  “provide” defense. Some examples include:  •   Armor  •   Cover  •   Certain talents  •   Guarded Stance maneuver  These sources do not stack with each other. If a char -  acter could benefit from more than one of these sources  of defense, you choose the best one.  However,   other   sources   increase   defense.   These  sources say they “increase” defense, or they list the  defense provided as a number with a “+” sign in front  of it. These sources of defense stack, both with each  other and with any sources that provide defense.  If   multiple   sources   that   increase   defense   would  increase a character’s defense higher than 4, the rating  remains at 4.  s oak  A character’s   soak value helps protect them from  incoming wounds. Most creatures and characters  have a default soak value equal to their Brawn rating.  Most types of armor and other forms of protection pro -  vide additional soak (see   Chapter 5: Equipment ).  When taking damage from attacks (actions involv -  ing a combat skill check) or other sources of physi -  cal damage (such as being struck by a falling rock or  being hit by a speeding car), the character may reduce  the damage taken by their soak value. After calculat -  ing the total amount of damage inflicted, subtract the  total soak value from that damage total. The result is  the number of wounds the character suffers. If the  soak reduces the damage to zero or less than zero,  then the character takes no damage. If the character  suffers multiple hits from a single attack (such as from  a weapon with Auto-fire), they apply their soak to  each hit separately.  Soak stacks when it is from different sources, such as  heavy assault armor and subdermal plating. Multiple  applications of the same source do not stack, however.  A character cannot wear three suits of heavy assault  armor and stack the soak bonuses from each.  Soak does not reduce strain inflicted on a target,  except in specific instances (such as when hit by a  weapon with the Stun Damage item quality).  r ange   b ands  G enesys   relies on broad terms to describe ranges  and distances. Rather than have a player’s atten -  tion focused on a grid, counting squares,   Genesys  uses more abstract means to represent positions, dis -  tances, and ranges, thus allowing the players to focus  on the action and the adventure.  The distance between two points—people, objects,  or adversaries—is defined by general range categories.  These range categories are used to determine how far a  ranged attack can reach, how far apart two people are  from each other, how much effort is needed to move  between two places, and so on. The most common  ranges are short, medium, long, and extreme range.  Another relative position—engaged—exists to repre -  sent characters who are in extremely close proximity  to each other. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

t he   f ive   r an G e   b an D s  For ease of play, distance in   Genesys   is divided up  into five different bands, from engaged to extreme. As  always, the GM has the final say in determining the  range between the attacker and the target.  With the engaged status and the other range bands,  the GM is free to describe things dynamically and set  scenes without having to worry about exact distances.  Exact distances in meters do not matter. The details  and adventure come first, creating a vivid picture in the  minds of the players while allowing the GM to quickly  provide the mechanical information they need to use  their actions and build strategies.  e n G a G e D  To reflect two or more targets who are grappling or  otherwise engaged in hand-to-hand combat, there is  a special range status called engaged. Two characters  engaged with each other are in very close proximity. A  warrior needs to be engaged with a target to hit them  with their sword. When two or more characters are  engaged with each other, it is called an engagement.  Engaged is also used to indicate that a person is  close enough to an item to use it. A hacker needs to be  engaged with a security terminal to attempt to hack it. A  pilot needs to be engaged with their fighter jet to board  it. A hunter needs to be engaged with a tree if they want  to hide behind it for cover while tracking their target.  The engaged status simply indicates that two things are  close enough to each other to directly interact.  Consider engaged as a subcategory of short range.  Obviously, someone can be slightly farther away if  they’re at short range, instead of being engaged with  someone else. However, the difference in distance  is relatively minor. Thus, spending a maneuver to  move to engage someone or something is as much a  matter of moving into combat cautiously enough to  avoid receiving a blow unnecessarily as it is moving  a physical distance.  s hort   r an G e  Short range indicates up to several meters between  targets. Many thrown weapons and small firearms are  most accurate at short range. Two people within short  range of each other can talk comfortably without rais -  ing their voices. Moving to another spot within short  range is usually easy to do and generally only requires  one maneuver.  m e D ium   r an G e  Medium range can be up to several dozen meters away.  More reliable pistols can reach to medium range, but  few thrown weapons can reach this far. Two people  within medium range of each other need to talk loudly  to hear each other. Moving from short range to medium  range takes little exertion and generally requires one  maneuver.  l on G   r an G e  Long range is farther than a few dozen meters.  Rifles, mounted weapons, and weapons that use the  Gunnery skill can reliably reach this far without too Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 107  much trouble. Two people within long range of each  other need to yell loudly to hear each other. Mov -  ing from medium range to long range requires two  maneuvers, as it involves a greater distance and takes  more time than moving between medium range and  short range. This means that in most cases, a char -  acter cannot close the distance between short and  long range in a single round, as it would take three  maneuvers (one for short to medium, plus two for  medium to long).  e xtreme   r an G e  Extreme range is the farthest range at which two  targets can interact. High-tech sniper weaponry and  some vehicle-mounted armaments may reach out to  this range. Two people at extreme range may not be  able to hear each other even if they shout. Moving  between long range and extreme range can be time-  consuming and exerting, and it requires two maneu -  vers. This means that in most cases, a character can  move the entire distance between long and extreme  range in a single round, but suffers strain or gives up  their action to do so.  a dditional   C o M bat   M odifiers  T he prior sections cover the fundamentals of mak -  ing a basic combat check. However, combat rarely  occurs in a vacuum. Any number of things can modify a  combat check, from environmental factors to actions the  character chooses.  This section discusses those modifiers. Here we’re going  to cover conditional and situational modifiers. After that,  the next section will discuss environmental effects, which  can modify combat and non-combat encounters.  c on D itional   an D   s ituational   m o D ifiers  Character choices can modify combat checks in many  ways, some good and some bad. These choices often  provide additional benefits as well.  m akin G   r an G e D   a ttacks   at   e n G a G e D   t ar G ets  Sometimes, characters may want to attack a target  engaged with another character. If the target and the  character with whom they are engaged are both ene -  mies of the attacker, the attacker may not worry about  whom they might hit. However, if one of the characters  is an ally, then things become more dangerous.  When attacking a target engaged with an ally, the  attacker upgrades the difficulty of the check once (for  more on upgrading difficulty, see page   22 ). In addi -  tion, if the attacker’s check succeeds but generates at  least one   󲊲 , that   󲊲   is automatically spent to make the  attacker hit one of the individuals engaged with the tar -  get (of the GM’s choice), instead of hitting the target.  m akin G   r an G e D   a ttacks   W   hile   e n G a G e D  Sometimes, a character may want to make a ranged  attack even though they’re locked in hand-to-hand  combat with an enemy. Such an action can be risky;  a character may find it hard to take the time to line up  a shot while an opponent is swinging an axe at them!  Any opponent engaged with a character when the  character makes a ranged attack (no matter who the  target is) may add   󲊸   to their next Brawl or Melee check  against that character. They automatically lose this  bonus if they and the character are no longer engaged  with each other.  In addition, the difficulty of some ranged attacks  increases while the attacker and an enemy are engaged,  r elative   p ositioning  Because of the narrative, abstract way in which  distance is measured, both the players and Game  Master must be aware of how positioning relative  to two or more targets is measured. Once combat  begins, the Game Master tells each player where  their character is relative to the opponents. It’s then  up to the player to track their character’s range  relative to those opponents as the battle progresses.  For example, during a battle within a huge han -  gar bay, the PCs are ambushed by four security  guards. Two approach from one side and two  from the other. The GM indicates that each pair  of security guards is in the medium range band  with respect to the characters. During their turns,  the PCs split up to attack. Two of the PCs move  toward one group of guards, getting within short  range, and the other group moves to the opposite  set of guards. Both groups of characters are now  within short range of their respective targets, but  at medium range from the other group of targets. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 108  and other ranged attacks become impossible. See  Table I.6–4: Ranged Modifiers   for more information.  You should note that this chart differentiates based  on types of weapons, because in the core rules, there  is only one kind of combat skill that lets you attack  at range. If your setting has multiple ranged combat  skills (such as separate skills for “light” and “heavy”  ranged weapons), then the ranged modifiers can be  determined by skill, rather than weapon size. Gener -  ally, it should be obvious which of your combat skills  match up with which ranged modifiers.  a ttackin G   p rone   t ar G ets   an D   a ttackin G   W   hile   p rone  A character who is knocked down, unconscious, or  willingly drops prone is considered prone.  Prone characters are easier to hit with certain combat  checks and find it harder to use certain combat skills. A  character gains   󲊸   when attacking a prone target with  a Melee check (or any other close combat check). A  prone character suffers   󲊸   when making a melee attack  from a prone position.  Prone characters are harder to hit with ranged attacks  but suffer no penalties when making ranged attacks.  When a character attacks a prone target with a ranged  attack, they suffer   󲊸 .  Some attacks or weapons may cause a character  to become prone. This is indicated in the individual  weapon, talent, or creature attack entry. Getting knocked  prone may be the result of a failed Coordination check  or of the activation of a weapon’s item quality.  t W o   -W   eapon   c ombat  A character may opt to carry a pistol or a one-handed  Melee weapon in each hand, increasing their volume of  attacks at the expense of accuracy.  When attacking with two weapons, the charac -  ter must be using weapons that can each be reason -  ably held and wielded in one hand. Generally, these  weapons are Ranged (Light) weapons—such as pis -  tols and grenades—and one-handed Melee weapons  or Brawl weapons. If it’s unclear whether or not a  weapon can be wielded one-handed, the GM makes  the final determination.  To make the attack, the player performs a combined  check. First, the player designates one weapon as the  primary weapon. When making the combined check,  the character attacks with this weapon. The player  then determines which skills and characteristics the  character uses when making attacks with the pri -  mary weapon and which are used with the second -  ary weapon (the other weapon wielded). Finally, they  determine the target.  To assemble the dice pool for this check, the player  compares the skills that would be used to make an  attack with each weapon by itself, and then compares  the characteristics that would be used to make an attack  with each weapon by itself. They then take the skill that  they have fewer ranks in, and the characteristic that  they have fewer ranks in, and use this skill and char -  acteristic to assemble their dice pool. It’s very possible  that the ranks in either the skills or characteristics are  equal, in which case they can use either. If both checks  would use the same skill or characteristic, they simply  use that skill or characteristic.  They then compare the difficulty of the two combat  checks they would make with each of their two weapons  to hit their target, and select the check with the higher  difficulty. Then, they increase the difficulty of the combat  check by one. Finally, they make the check.  If they succeed, they hit with their primary weapon  in the normal manner. They may spend   󲊴   󲊴   or   󲊵   to  hit with their secondary weapon as well. If both weap -  ons hit, they may spend additional   󲊴   or   󲊵   to activate  item qualities from either weapon. Each hit deals its  weapon’s base damage plus one point of damage per  uncanceled success.  u narme D   c ombat  Although most characters probably feel more comfort -  able going into a fight with a good gun in their hand,  there are times they must rely on their fists, feet, or  other appendages.  Characters   fighting   unarmed   generally   use   the  Brawl skill. Unlike other combat skills, the Brawl skill  is designed to be used independently of any weapon  (although some weapons can be used in conjunction  with the Brawl skill).

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 109  When a character makes an unarmed combat check  using Brawl, the attack has a base damage of their Brawn  rating, a range of engaged, a Critical rating of 5, and the  Knockdown item quality. Finally, when making a Brawl  attack, the attacker can choose to deal damage to the  target’s strain threshold instead of its wound threshold,  still reducing the damage by the target’s soak.  Unlike   other   weapons,   Brawl   weapons   augment  this basic attack. Brawl weapons can add damage to  the attack (as indicated in the   Brawl   profile, on page  67 ) and may have an improved Critical rating and  additional item qualities. When using a Brawl weapon,  the user can choose to use its Critical rating instead of  the standard Brawl Critical rating. They also add any  additional item qualities to the qualities already pro -  vided by the Brawl attack. If the weapon provides an  improved version of an existing quality, the character  uses the improved version.  i mprovise D   W   eapons  Sometimes a character doesn’t have a real weapon  available and must make do with anything that is on  hand. Swinging a broken bottle, heavy tool, large rock,  or tree branch at a target are all examples of using an  improvised weapon.  Improvised weapons use the Melee skill, and as with  all Melee weapons, the attacker adds their Brawn to  the damage dealt. Just like weapons with the Inferior  quality, improvised weapons generate one automatic  󲊱   on any check. Improvised weapons deal damage  based on their size and general weight, as described  in   Table I.6–5: Improvised Weapons . Any attack roll  that results in a   󲊲   or   󲊱   󲊱   indicates that the impro -  vised weapon breaks and is useless in further rounds of  combat. Large improvised weapons require two hands  to use if the user is silhouette 1 or smaller.  s ize   D   ifferences   ( s ilhouettes   )  Generally, it’s a character’s skill that governs their  chances of hitting a target. However, some targets are  easier to hit than others, usually because of their size.  Size, or silhouette, is important in the alternate rules  for vehicles (see page   220 ). However, silhouettes can  affect attack difficulties in standard combat as well.  When a character makes an attack against a target  with a silhouette two or more points larger than they  are, they decrease the difficulty of the check by one.  When a character makes an attack against a target with  a silhouette two or more points smaller than they are,  they increase the difficulty of the check by one.  Table I.6–6: Silhouettes and Characters   has a list of  example silhouettes that covers the size of most crea -  tures the PCs may encounter. The most important thing  to remember is that most characters are silhouette 1.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 110  e nviron M ental   e ffe C ts  Y our characters may end up adventuring in count -  less environments, from the frozen wastes of the  icy tundra, to lost ruins in steamy jungles, to the bus -  tling streets of busy cities. Characters can often find  themselves fighting in hazardous or exotic circum -  stances, ranging from the cold, hard vacuum of space  to the infernal heat of a volcanic planet. The following  sections cover rules imposed by those environments.  c oncealment   (D arkness ,   s moke ,   an D   i ntervenin G   t errain )  Concealment is a situation that occurs when a character  is hard to spot because of environmental effects such as  darkness, smoke, tall grass, or mist. Concealment imposes  penalties on ranged attacks and sight-based skill checks  such as many Perception checks. Conversely, it can pro -  vide bonuses for checks on other skills, such as Stealth.  The exact bonuses and penalties can be modified by  the GM if needed. However, in general, concealment  can be divided into levels based on how obscuring the  concealment is. See   Table   I.6 –7: Concealment   for  examples of different types of concealment. In each  case, the type of concealment adds a number of   󲊸  equal to the “Dice Added” entry to any ranged combat  checks, Vigilance checks, or Perception checks against  targets with concealment. Conversely, it adds a number  of   󲊸   equal to the “Dice Added” entry to any Stealth  checks made by a character with concealment. These  Boosts or Setbacks may also be added to other skill  checks if the GM feels it’s appropriate.  c over  When the guns start firing, most characters dive for  cover. To keep things simple, being behind some sort  of cover—a rock, crate, wall, or vehicle, for example—  allows the character to gain a ranged defense of 1 and  adds   󲊸   to certain skill checks, such as Perception. A  single   󲊸   is sufficient for most situations, although the  GM may add additional   󲊸   if the target is particularly  well covered, such as if they are within a trench, block -  house, bunker, or any other prepared position. The  same holds true for the increase in ranged defense.  D   ifficult   an D   i mpassable   t errain  Difficult terrain is a catchall description of terrain that  is hard to move through or over. It can include tight  passageways, slippery ice, thick undergrowth, loose  rubble, shifting sand, or waist-deep water (or any  number of other circumstances). Essentially, it’s terrain  that characters move through with difficulty. Charac -  ters entering or moving through difficult terrain must  perform twice as many maneuvers to move the same  distance they would in normal terrain.  Impassable terrain is a description of terrain that is  simply impossible to move through via maneuvers. This  includes sheer cliffs, walls higher than a character can  jump, and deep pits. Impassable terrain is not always  an insurmountable obstacle, but it’s an obstacle that  requires special skills to circumvent. Depending on the  impassable terrain in question and the resources at the  character’s disposal, the GM may allow the character  to overcome impassable terrain by using a skill, prob -  ably the Athletics or Coordination skill (see   Chapter 3:  Skills   on page   52 ). During an encounter, this means  the character must spend at least one action (and pos -  sibly give up one or more maneuvers) to accomplish this.  G   ravity  If your game takes place in a futuristic setting, characters  might find themselves in a situation where they are away  from an artificial gravity device, floating in open space,  or walking in the crushing gravity of a supergiant planet.  Normal gravity is the default and does not affect any  skill checks, attacks, or the like. However, sometimes the  characters end up in an environment without normal  gravity: a starship with artificial gravity that has been dis -  rupted by damage (or, depending on the setting, a star -  ship without artificial gravity at all) or a large planet with a  higher-than-normal gravitational pull, for instance.  Stronger-than-normal gravity adds up to   󲊸   󲊸   󲊸  to any Brawn-based skill checks (except Resilience  checks) and to Coordination skill checks, depending  on how strong the gravity is. Weaker-than-normal  gravity adds up to   󲊸   󲊸   󲊸   to any Brawn-based skill  checks (except Resilience checks) and Coordination  skill checks, depending on how weak the gravity is.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 111  Zero gravity, on the other hand, does not grant any  󲊸   or   󲊸   to skill checks, because moving in zero gravity  is completely different from moving in a gravity field.  Characters can move in three dimensions in zero grav -  ity, but they count all movement as movement through  difficult terrain, due to having to constantly grab hand -  holds, evaluate angles, and so forth.  A character’s encumbrance threshold does not change  due to different gravity, and items still maintain their  usual encumbrance. This is because an item’s weight  may change, but its size and mass (and therefore its iner -  tia) do not. Those pesky details can prove an unpleasant  surprise to inexperienced spacers who attempt to shift  something large and heavy while in zero gravity.  W   ater   an D   s W immin G  Bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and  swamps are pretty common in most locations, and  sometimes characters need to cross them. Luckily,  most individuals can swim, although some may be a lot  better at it than others! Unless otherwise noted, charac -  ters treat any body of water as difficult terrain. The GM  may also decide that some bodies of water, such as a  river with a swift current or an ocean in a storm, are so  difficult to move through that they require a successful  Athletics check to swim in. In this case, it requires at  least one action as well as any number of maneuvers to  swim through the water from one location to another.  If completely submerged in water, a character can  hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their  Brawn characteristic. Once this number is reached, the  character starts to drown and is treated as suffocating  (see   Suffocation , page   112 ) on each successive round  until they surface or find some other source of air.  v acuum  For astronauts, vacuum is an all-too-familiar and  extremely dangerous environment lurking just out -  side the protective hull of their starship. Vacuum is not  just the lack of breathable air; the lack of pressure and  extreme heat or cold can cause veins to rupture, blood  to boil, and delicate membranes to freeze or tear.  When exposed to vacuum without protective gear, a  character may hold their breath for a number of rounds  equal to their Brawn characteristic. Once this num -  ber is reached, the character begins suffocating (see  Suffocation   on page   112 ). Furthermore, during each  round in which a character is exposed to vacuum, they  also suffer 3 wounds. When the character exceeds their  wound threshold, they are incapacitated and suffer one  Critical Injury as usual, plus one additional Critical  Injury during each additional round in which they are  exposed to vacuum (which likely and quickly results in  death). This is in addition to the Critical Injuries they  suffer from suffocating.  f ire   ,   a ci D ,   an D   c orrosive   a tmospheres  Fundamentally, the effects of fire, acids, and corrosive  atmospheres are treated with the same rules. When  characters are exposed to a fire, acid, or a   corrosive  atmosphere, the GM determines how dangerous the  situation is by applying a rating. This rating is gener -  ally between 1 and 10, although higher ratings may also  apply. A lower rating typically indicates minor, low-heat  fire or mildly corrosive liquid or atmosphere. The higher  the rating, the hotter the fire or the more corrosive the  atmosphere. See   Table I.6–8: Fire, Acid, and Corrosive  Atmospheres   for some examples of different ratings.  Each round at the beginning of their turn, a char -  acter subjected to one of these hazards suffers wounds  equal to its rating. This damage persists until they are  no longer exposed to the hazard. With some corrosive  atmospheres, the GM may decide they do not cause  damage unless inhaled. In such cases, the character can  hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their  Brawn before having to breathe and suffer damage.  It’s primarily up to the GM to decide how long the  damage from one of these sources lasts. Acids usually  neutralize themselves after a certain period of time  (as few as several rounds, or as long as several min -  utes or hours). Fires burn for as long as they have a  fuel source, which again could be very briefly or for a  very long time. A corrosive atmosphere, on the other  hand, usually deals damage as long as the character is  exposed to it.  Putting out fire/neutralizing acid:   A victim might  be able to stop the damage caused by fire by rolling  TABLE I.6–8: FIRE, ACID, AND  CORROSIVE ATMOSPHERES  Rating   Examples  1–2  Campfires, mildly caustic substances such as  concentrated industrial cleansers, air filled with ash  and fumes from a heavy fire  3–5  Flammable liquids and flamethrowers, dangerous  substances such as industrial acids, air contaminated  by chemical leaks  6–9  Welding torches, weaponized acids, atmospheres with  substantial parts dangerous gases such as ammonia  or chlorine  10+  Lava, blast furnaces, atmospheres completely made of  unbreathable and hazardous gases such as ammonia-  methane mixes with acid vapors Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

This is an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) check   on hard sur -  faces such as the deck of a spaceship, or an   Easy ( 󲊷 )  check   on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of  water stops the damage immediately. In the case of  acid, it’s up to the GM to determine if the same pro -  cedures negate the damage, or if the character must  apply some neutralizing substance instead. The only  way to stop taking damage from a corrosive atmo -  sphere is to leave it.  s uffocation  A suffocating character suffers 3 strain each round at  the beginning of their turn, until they are no longer  suffocating (how to stop suffocating depends entirely  on the circumstances that led to the suffocation in the  first place, but it usually involves reaching a breathable  atmosphere or removing something preventing the  character from breathing). Once the character exceeds  their strain threshold, they are incapacitated. In addi -  tion, at the beginning of each of their subsequent turns,  if the character is still suffocating, they suffer one Criti -  cal Injury. This continues until the character stops suf -  focating or dies.  f allin G  Gravity kills. If a character falls from a height, the GM  should determine the distance between the location  from which the character fell and their point of impact  below, then apply the closest comparable range band.  Next, the GM consults   Table I.6–9: Falling Damage   to  determine the damage suffered. Damage is reduced by  soak; however, the strain suffered is not.  A character can reduce the damage taken from falling  by making an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Athletics   or   Coordina -  tion check . Each   󲊳   reduces the damage suffered by one,  while each   󲊴   reduces the strain suffered by one. A   󲊵  could, at the GM’s discretion, reduce the overall distance  fallen by one range band as the character grabs onto a  handhold or does something else to arrest their fall.  w ounds ,   s train ,   and   s tates   of   h ealth  I n the fast-paced, high-action setting of   Genesys ,  characters are sure to find themselves in the thick of  things, and they are likely to pick up a few cuts and bruises  along the way. A character’s health is tracked using two  separate yet similar systems: strain and wounds.  W oun D s   an D   W oun D   t hreshol D  A wide variety of items and actions can inflict physi -  cal damage: gunshots, an angry bear’s claws, frag gre -  nades, falling, etc. Damage to a character’s physical  body is tracked using wounds. Each point of dam -  age inflicts 1 wound on a character. A character can  only withstand so many wounds before becoming  incapacitated. This is represented by the character’s  wound threshold.  e xcee D in G   W   oun D   t hreshol D  When a PC suffers wounds greater than their wound  threshold, they are knocked out and incapacitated until  their   wounds are reduced so that they no longer exceed  their wound threshold (likely through healing). They  also immediately suffer one Critical Injury. In some  rare and dire circumstances, this could result in the  PC’s death.  When non-player characters and creatures suffer  wounds greater than their wound threshold, they are  defeated (unless they are a high-level opponent such as  a nemesis). Being defeated by exceeding their wound  threshold usually entails death, but the overall inter -  pretation is up to the GM. The GM can decide that they  pass out due to shock, are so injured that they can no  longer fight, are knocked unconscious, or suffer any  other option that fits the GM’s plans for the ongoing  narrative. Since non-nemesis NPCs do not track strain  separately, but apply strain damage as wounds to their  wound threshold, what happens once they are defeated  may also depend on whether they were defeated due to  strain damage or wound damage.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 113  When wounds exceed a character’s wound thresh -  old, the player should track the number of wounds by  which their character has exceeded the threshold, to  a maximum of twice the wound threshold. The char -  acter must heal wounds until the number of wounds  they are suffering is below their wound threshold  before the character is no longer incapacitated.  s train   an D   s train   t hreshol D  While wounds and Critical Injuries represent poten -  tially life-threatening damage, a number of other  stressors and effects can also impair a character. Col -  lectively, this is referred to as strain.  Any effect that impairs the character, but does not  inflict physical harm or wounds, is considered   strain.  Spending hours wandering through blistering deserts,  suffering a minor shock from an electric console, being  battered around the inside of a moving shipping crate—  all of these could represent types of strain. Weapons  with a Stun or Stun Damage quality or other effects that  impair or hinder a character also inflict strain.  Additionally, effects that cause stress, fear, anxiety,  or emotional turmoil also generate strain. Losing one’s  cool in combat during a bombardment, being berated  by a superior officer, waking up to realize one has been  imprisoned by slavers, or having one’s ship boarded by  an armed search team while smuggling goods are all  incidents that could result in strain on a character.  Strain   can   accumulate   slowly   as   environmental  effects or be gained in chunks when a PC is rattled by  an effect that doesn’t cause damage but still impairs  them.  Characters can also voluntarily suffer strain to trig -  ger certain effects. The most common use is to volun -  tarily suffer 2 strain to gain one additional maneuver  during a character’s turn.  Some talents may require the character to suffer 1 or  more strain to activate.  e xcee D in G   s train   t hreshol D  When a character has suffered strain greater than their  strain threshold, they become incapacitated until their  strain is reduced so that it no longer exceeds their  strain threshold. They are likely unconscious, or they  may just be so dazed and staggered that they’re com -  pletely unaware of their surroundings and unable to  interact with them.  When non-player characters and creatures suffer  strain, they generally apply the strain directly to their  wound threshold (unless they are nemeses and track  strain separately).  s tates   of   h ealth  Player characters may pass through several states of  health over the course of their adventures. State of  health is a general representation of overall fitness  or well-being.  A character is   unwounded   and operating at peak  performance if they are currently suffering from no  wounds and have no Critical Injuries.  A character is   wounded   if they have any number  of wounds below their wound threshold. At this  point, they have suffered a few cuts, bruises, and  scrapes. However, they have not taken any perma -  nent or incapacitating damage. They’re a bit bat -  tered, but they are still hale and hearty overall.  A character is   critically injured   if they are cur -  rently   suffering   from   any   number   of   Critical  Injuries, regardless of how many wounds they may  have. Critical Injuries are actual injuries that have  some sort of detrimental effect. A character may be  critically injured and wounded.  A character is   incapacitated   once they have suf -  fered more wounds than their wound threshold  or more strain than their strain threshold. Inca -  pacitation means that a character is unconscious  and no longer able to act until the number of  wounds or strain they are suffering is decreased  below their wound or strain threshold.  Since exceeding a character’s wound threshold  triggers a Critical Injury, it’s possible (and often  likely!) for an incapacitated character to also be  critically injured. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 114  C riti C al   i njuries  A particularly dangerous type of harm is a Critical  Injury. A Critical Injury is often the result of an  attack during combat, but characters can also suffer one  from exceeding their wound threshold or through other  means. Each time a character suffers a Critical Injury,  the player rolls d100 on   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury  Result , on page   115 , to determine the injury’s severity  rating and effects.  The short-term effects of some injuries are tempo -  rary, and may only disorient or afflict the character for  a brief amount of time. Other injuries are more serious  and represent some sort of long-term debilitation or  impairment. These injuries continue to affect the char -  acter until they receive the proper medical treatment to  recover from the injury.  Regardless, a Critical Injury remains with the charac -  ter until properly healed; even if the short-term effect  of the Critical Injury has passed, the status of having  a Critical Injury remains. Each Critical Injury a char -  acter suffers from adds +10 to any subsequent Critical  Injury roll. Essentially, Critical Injury is cumulative,  and left untreated, even a number of relatively minor  Critical Injuries can lead to devastating results.  o ther   o ngoing   s tatus   e ffe C ts  C haracters can suffer status effects beyond being  wounded or incapacitated. These status effects can  change what a character can do during an encounter,  and can be very dangerous.  Conversely, the power to inflict them on others can  be a very potent ability indeed.  s ta GG ere D  A staggered character cannot perform actions (includ -  ing downgrading actions to maneuvers). Most effects  that stagger a character last for a set duration. If a set  duration is not specified, the staggered effect lasts until  the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is  staggered multiple times, each instance increases the  total duration of the effect by the instance’s speci -  fied duration, but may not increase the total duration  beyond the scope of the present encounter.  i mmobilize D  An   immobilized character cannot perform maneu -  vers (including maneuvers purchased via strain or by  spending   󲊴 ). Most effects that immobilize a charac -  ter last for a set duration. If a set duration is not speci -  fied, immobilization lasts until the end of the charac -  ter’s next turn.

Although this may seem odd, it actually makes  sense. When a player character inflicts a Critical  Injury on an adversary that can be incapacitated  by a single Critical Injury (such as a minion), then  the adversary is simply incapacitated by being  rendered unconscious. If a PC or nemesis NPC  suffers a Critical Injury from a weapon dealing  strain damage, the outcome can be anything from  adverse long-term effects from the weapon, to  tangential injuries from being stunned (for exam -  ple, the character could be knocked off balance  and take a nasty crack on the skull when they hit  the ground). Of course, since these Critical Inju -  ries would have to be triggered by the players or  GM, both parties can always decide that a Criti -  cal Injury would not make sense in that narrative,  and choose not to trigger them.

A time may come when a  PC faces their ultimate fate and perishes.  If a character ever rolls (or, through multiple or  untreated Critical Injuries, otherwise suffers) a result of  151 or higher on   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result ,  they die (they also have a chance of death with a 141  result). A dead character cannot be brought back to life.  Similarly, a destroyed robotic or android character may  not be restored—their central processing unit has been  irrevocably damaged. Either way, the player should move  on and create a new character to continue the adventure.  For more on the death of a player character, see  Chapter 8: The Game Master   on page   125 .  r e C overy   and   h ealing  W hile characters can be afflicted with various ail -  ments and types of damage, there are thankfully  several options for recovery. Recovery can vary in time  and effectiveness, based on the resources and expertise  available to the characters. With the proper resources  and sufficient time, characters can recover from virtu -  ally any encounter.  h ealin G   W oun D s  There are several ways that characters can heal wounds.  Some allow for natural, if slow, healing; others require  access to high-tech medical facilities.  n atural   r est  For each full night’s rest, the character heals one wound,  regardless of the character’s current state of health. At the  end of each full week of rest, the character may attempt  a Resilience check to recover from one Critical Injury.  The difficulty is equal to the Critical Injury’s severity  rating (see   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result , on  page   115 ). On a successful check, the character recov -  ers from the Critical Injury and is no longer affected.  On a failed check, the character retains the Critical  Injury, but still heals one wound. A   󲊵   result means the  character can heal one additional Critical Injury.  m e D ical   c are  A character may attempt a Medicine check to help a  character heal wounds. Each character may only receive  one Medicine check each encounter, as there is only so  much good that first aid can do to help a character.  The difficulty of the check is based on the target’s cur -  rent state of health (see   Table I.6–11: Medical Check  Difficulty ). On a successful check, the target heals a  number of wounds equal to the number of   󲊳   gener -  ated by the Medicine roll and heals an amount of strain  equal to the number of   󲊴   generated.  A character may also attempt to help someone  recover from a Critical Injury by making a Medicine  check with a difficulty equal to the severity rating of  the Critical Injury (see   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury  Result ). A character may attempt one Medicine check  per week per Critical Injury.  A character may attempt to heal their own wounds or  Critical Injuries with Medicine, but doing this themselves  increases the difficulty of the Medicine check by two. In  addition, attempting a Medicine check without medical  equipment of some kind (such as a first aid kit or doctor’s  tools) increases the difficulty of the check by one.  p ainkillers  Painkillers are our generic term for consumable auto -  healing items (see page   94 ). Regardless of the setting  or their name, they all work the same way.  The first painkiller used on a character automati -  cally heals 5 wounds. The second painkiller only heals  4 wounds, the third painkiller heals 3 wounds, and so  on. The sixth painkiller has no effect (we say the target  is too oversaturated with medicine or healing magic or  whatever to benefit from anything else).  TABLE I.6–11: MEDICAL CHECK DIFFICULTY  State of Health   Difficulty  Current wounds equal half or less of  wound threshold   Easy ( 󲊷 )  Current wounds equal more than half  of wound threshold   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )  Current wounds exceed  wound threshold   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )  Critical Injury   Critical Injury severity rating Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Administering a painkiller requires one maneuver,  and the character doing the administering must be  engaged with the target to treat them. This also means  that a character with a free hand can administer a pain -  killer to themself by spending a maneuver.  Painkillers (in any of their variants) can never heal  Critical Injuries.  r ecoverin G   from   s train  Fortunately, recovering from strain is fairly easy. Tak -  ing a moment to catch one’s breath, eating a good meal,  and spending time relaxing with friends are all ways a  player character might recover from strain.  At the end of an encounter, each player can make a  Simple (–) Discipline   or   Cool check . Each   󲊳   recovers  1 strain. Furthermore, a good night’s rest generally  removes all strain a character has suffered.  r ecoverin G   from   c ritical   i njuries  Since lingering   Critical Injuries make subsequent inju -  ries increasingly dangerous, they should be treated as  quickly and efficiently as possible. Critical Injuries vary  in severity, which represents the difficulty of any corre -  sponding Medicine check to treat and remove the injury.  It’s important to note that even if the effect of a Criti -  cal Injury has expired, the Critical Injury still persists  until treated. For example, with a Critical Injury result  of 23, which indicates the Off-Balance Critical Injury,  the character adds   󲊸   to their next skill check. Even  after this effect has been applied, the Off-Balance Criti -  cal Injury still exists and lingers until treated, making  subsequent Critical Injury rolls against the character  that much more dangerous to them.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 118  CHAPTER 7: SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS  I n the previous chapter, we went over the rules for com -  bat encounters. Just as combat is a common part of  roleplaying games, social encounters are also common.  So, in this chapter, we discuss what a social encounter is  and some rules for running social encounters.  W hat   i s   a   s ocial   e ncounter ?  Whereas combat encounters are fairly well defined,  social encounters are slightly less so. The primary  reason for this is that social encounters use narrative  gameplay, while combat encounters use the struc -  tured gameplay rules. Since structured gameplay is  essentially a defined subset of rules—your characters  roll for Initiative to enter it, and stop using those rules  when your opponents are all dead or defeated—it’s  easy to determine when a combat encounter takes  place.   Social   encounters   don’t   have   those   clearly  delineated boundaries.  For our purposes, a social encounter is an encounter  that primarily focuses on your party of player charac -  ters engaging with non-player characters in discourse  or dialog. The encounter likely focuses on the PCs try -  ing to accomplish some sort of goal, while the NPCs are  directly or indirectly opposing them.  For example, a social encounter could take the form  of your characters trying to buy a new car for the low -  est possible price, while the car dealer (an NPC) tries  to make them pay as much as possible. In a different  social encounter, your characters might try to con -  vince a gang of battle-hardened mercenaries to turn  on their employer. The mercenaries (all NPCs) may  not initially be willing to do so and might need to be  persuaded. In yet another social encounter, your char -  acters might try to charm the mayor of a local town.  Whatever the PCs’ goal, perhaps the mayor is in oppo -  sition to it, and his neutral opinion of them needs to  be changed to a favorable one if he is to change his  mind about the issue at hand.  That’s the basic overview of a social encounter. Now,  let’s get into some more details.  n arrative   G ameplay  We discussed the difference between narrative and  structured   gameplay   on   page   95   in   Chapter   6:  Combat Encounters . There, we talked primarily  about structured gameplay. In this chapter, we focus  on narrative gameplay instead, particularly its use in  social encounters.  Narrative gameplay is not broken into rounds and  turns, with each of your characters limited to a set  number of actions and maneuvers. Instead, gameplay  flows narratively, by which we mean that you and the  other players have your characters act when it makes  sense as part of the ongoing story, and your GM does  the same with their NPCs.  In short, narrative gameplay is a lot more flexible,  making it the obvious mode of play for the majority of  a roleplaying game. The one element of structure that  narrative and structured gameplay shares, however, is  that gameplay is still broken up into encounters.  Just like scenes in a movie, encounters serve as use -  ful organizational blocks, with the breaks between  them offering a helpful pause in the action. That’s why  we designed the game to incorporate them. Many  character abilities can only be used “once per encoun -  ter,” meaning that encounters need to end and new  encounters need to begin so that your characters get  a chance to refresh those abilities. Characters also get  the chance to recover strain (see page   117 ) at the  end of any encounter, not just combat encounters. So,  those encounter endings are important to ensure your  characters aren’t passing out from the strain they’ve  accumulated.  Here are a few brief suggestions as to when an  encounter can end and another encounter can begin.  •   When the party leaves a location. Traveling always  provides a good pause to the narrative.  •   When the narrative skips ahead (or back) in time.  Most games don’t follow a strict chronological pro -  gression, and we’ve found that it’s pretty common  for a GM to say “Ok, does anyone else have some -  thing they want their characters to do? If not, let’s  move the game ahead to this evening, when the  next event is going to happen.”  •   When the group finishes interacting with an indi -  vidual or group of individuals.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 119  s tru C turing   s o C ial   e n C ounters  I n this section, we talk about how to organize a social  encounter, and then cover some rules you should use  when running one.  Because social encounters use narrative gameplay,  not structured gameplay, they’re a lot more free-form  than combat encounters. This is good for you if you’re  the GM, because it means you are able to run these  encounters as you like, without having to worry about  incorporating a lot of rules. However, this also means  you have to do more planning in advance, because you  don’t have the rules to fall back on!  D etermine   the   G oal  If you are the GM, the first thing you should do when  building a social encounter is figure out what your par -  ty’s goal is going to be. Remember, we talked earlier in  this chapter about social encounters focusing on char -  acters trying to accomplish some sort of goal. That goal  can be something simple (get the best price possible  for that car) or complex (negotiate peace between two  feuding crime families).  If the goal is really complex (say, negotiating peace  between two warring interstellar empires), then you  may want to break that goal down into several sub-  goals, and make each one a separate encounter.  s et   a   s tart   an D   e n D  Once you have the goal figured out, you need to deter -  mine a start and end point for the encounter. The easiest  way to do this (and thus, the one we recommend) is to  start the encounter when your party first meets the char -  acter or characters whom they’re going to be interacting  with. Then, end the encounter when the party has either  accomplished their goal or failed so thoroughly that  accomplishing the goal is no longer possible.  m ana G e   t imin G   an D   a bility   u se  A lot of player characters in your party (and a lot of  non-player characters) have abilities such as talents or  archetype abilities that your players are going to want  to use during a social encounter.  Some of these abilities are limited to being used  once per encounter, or sometimes once per session.  You don’t have to worry about managing the timing  of these abilities, since they work within your exist -  ing timing structure (you’ve already defined when the  current encounter begins and ends, and once-per-  session abilities are designed to be used at any point  during a session).  However, a lot of abilities simply require the char -  acter to spend an action or a maneuver to use them.  These can prove tricky in a narrative gameplay encoun -  ter like a social encounter. Narrative gameplay doesn’t  track a character’s turn or the number of actions and  maneuvers they can perform the same way structured  gameplay does. This means that you, as the GM, may  need to establish some limits.  u sin G   r oun D s   in   s ocial   e ncounters  One way to establish those limits—and also ensure that  each of your players has a chance to participate in a  given encounter—is to use rounds.  In narrative encounters, rounds work similarly to the  way they work in structured encounters. Essentially,  they serve as a limiter. Every character gets to act once  during a round, and does not get to act again until the  next round. This ensures everyone gets a chance to par -  ticipate, and no one character dominates the encounter.  If you use rounds in a social encounter, you don’t  need to track Initiative or turn order. Each character  should simply take their turn when it makes the most  narrative sense to do so. If a character has nothing to  contribute to the encounter at that time, the character’s  player can just have them pass (but at least they had  the opportunity to contribute, even if they didn’t take  it). The amount of game-world time each round takes  is much more open to GM interpretation than it is in  structured encounters; it may cover only a few minutes  or an entire hour of activity.  When a character acts, their player doesn’t have to  worry about being too precise regarding what that  character does. If the group is attending a fancy dress  ball, for example, a player may say their character starts  wandering through the ballroom, dancing with ran -  dom people. In this case, you shouldn’t track the exact  distance a character moves, or how many maneuvers  they spend dancing.  However, when a character acts, they are limited  to using only one ability that requires spending an  action, and using only one ability that requires spend -  ing a maneuver. If the character makes a skill check,  this replaces their chance to use an ability that requires  spending an action. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

When to use these rules is up to you, the GM. Keep  in mind that they do impose some additional structure  on a social encounter, and some limits on what your  players can do. Therefore, we recommend you only use  these rules in complex or lengthy social encounters or  in ones involving a lot of PCs and NPCs.  In short, if your players are buying that used car,  don’t bother using these rules. But if your players are  negotiating peace between two rival crime families,  consider using them.  s kill   c hecks   in   s ocial   e ncounters  Just like in every other aspect of our game, your char -  acters and your players’ characters make skill checks to  resolve the success or failure of their actions. In social  encounters, those character’s actions are likely to be  some sort of discourse or dialog, so the skills they’ll  use are most likely social skills (see page   54 ).  Often, your character is going to try to charm, coerce,  deceive, lead, or negotiate with a single individual. This  means your character is going to be making opposed skill  checks (see page   25 ). Sometimes, your character may  try to influence a group of people, which requires skill  checks with a set difficulty. However, expect most social  skill checks to be opposed (see   Table I.3–2:   on page   55 ).  If your character tries to influence a group, we do pro -  vide a table ( Table I.7–1: Difficulties Based on Group  Size ) suggesting some difficulties for the check. You’ll  note the difficulties start at   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) . Generally, it  shouldn’t be easier to influence a group than to influence  an individual. Thus, the GM should consider the audi -  ence and use Story Points or add   󲊸   to make the check  more difficult if the group is unlikely to be receptive.

You can find these in   Table I.7–  2: Spending   󲊴   and   󲊵   in Social Encounters   and   Table  I.7–3: Spending   󲊱   and   󲊲   in Social Encounters . Just  remember, these are options and suggestions, but they  aren’t an exhaustive list. If you have another idea for  spending these resources, suggest it to your GM. If you  are the GM, then go for it!  W innin G   s ocial   e ncounters  While “winning” in a combat encounter is pretty  straightforward (just defeat the opponents), how to  “win” a social encounter can seem less clear. Obviously,  characters want to accomplish their goal, but how you,  the GM, can do that without making it seem like an  arbitrary decision can be a bit trickier.  Given that, we have three suggestions as to how you  can determine if a character accomplishes their goal  successfully.  p roposin G   a   m utually   a G reeable   s olution  Since this is a roleplaying game, we think it should  always be possible for a character to accomplish goals  in a social encounter without rolling any dice at all.  Therefore, one option for successfully “winning” a  social encounter is for your character to offer a solution  that is completely satisfactory to the other characters  involved in the encounter.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 122  A simple example of this would be your character  agreeing to pay full price for an item in a store. No  check is needed, because of course a shopkeeper will  accept full price. This option can apply to more com -  plicated situations as well. However, the more complex  the solution, the more it relies on you, the player, to  argue or explain your character’s reasoning. Your GM  can always decide that the situation is complex enough  that it needs to be resolved with a skill check (though  they might give you a   󲊸   for good roleplaying!)  s uccee D in G   on   an   o ppose D   s ocial   s kill   c heck  This is our recommended method for resolving simple  social encounters. Your character makes the appropri -  ate social skill check, opposed by the target’s skill. If the  check is successful, your character accomplishes their  goal. If they fail, they do not.  This resolution works best for simple goals, such as  negotiating over the price of an item, attempting to  charm one’s way past a guard, or lying about the where -  abouts of one’s friends. For more complex social situa -  tions, we recommend the following option instead.  t ar G etin G   the   o pponent   ’   s   s train   t hreshol D  In more complex social encounters, we expect that  one successful check isn’t enough to accomplish your  character’s goals. In such cases, your character needs to  inflict strain on their target. This represents them wear -  ing the target down over time with constant arguments,  negotiations, threats, or even relentless flattery. Your  goal could be to inflict enough strain on the target to  convince them to reach a compromise with your char -  acter, or you could push them to exceed their strain  threshold and completely capitulate.  If your target is a rival or minion group, your strain  targets their wound threshold (since they don’t have a  strain threshold). However, if you incapacitate them,  your GM should still have the target capitulate, not  mysteriously drop dead!  c ompromise :   s train   e xcee D s   h alf   of   the   t ar G et ’ s   t hreshol D  Often in complex social encounters, you don’t need  someone to completely capitulate to your character’s  demands. A compromise where your character gets  the most important elements of what they want while  giving up as little as possible in return can be just as  rewarding, and far easier to obtain.  To force a target to reach a compromise with your  character, your character must inflict strain on the tar -  get greater than half of their strain threshold. At this  point, the target becomes willing to compromise with  regard to your character’s goals.  The exact nature of the compromise is up to you and  your GM. Your GM should know what your character  is trying to achieve, and have the target offer to agree to  some portion of those goals. In return, your character  has to offer something to the target as well. For example,  if your character is negotiating the surrender of an alien  species, the alien negotiator may agree to a cease-fire and  favorable trade concessions but require that the species  retain its sovereignty. If your character is trying to get  on good terms with a target, the target may ask them to  perform a minor favor to prove their good intentions.  Generally, what the target is willing to agree to  shouldn’t be at odds with their core principles or com -  pletely against their own interests. For that reason, your  GM has final say as to what the target is willing to offer.  No matter what, though, it should be more than what  the target would be willing to offer normally.  c apitulation   :   s train   e xcee D s   the   t ar G et   ’   s   t hreshol D  If your character wants to push for complete capitu -  lation instead of compromise, they can try to inflict  enough strain to exceed the target’s strain threshold.  Once a target exceeds their strain threshold, they  agree to your character’s goal or goals. In a series of del -  icate negotiations, they may agree to your character’s  terms instead of theirs. If your character was threaten -  ing to exterminate their home world, they may com -  pletely surrender to avoid destruction. If your charac -  ter was trying to ingratiate themself into the target’s  good graces, your character convinces the target that  they’re a true and loyal friend and ally.  Generally, capitulation means that the target gives  in completely. However, capitulation doesn’t mean you  get to completely dictate the target’s actions, nor is it  mind control. Your GM can determine that some goals  are just too extreme for anyone to agree to (although  you probably should have realized that before your  character chose that goal in the first place).  f ailure   :   y our   c haracter   e xcee D s   t heir   s train   t hreshol D  If your character exceeds their strain threshold, then  they fail to accomplish their goals. They may just give  up trying to interact with their opponent and leave.  However, your GM could decide that, depending on  the circumstances, your character is forced to concede  to one of your target’s goals, instead.  Since your character is a PC, and not a non-player  character, you can choose whether your character would  be open to compromise if their strain exceeds half of  their strain threshold. This can be a good roleplaying cue  to follow, but since PCs are the protagonists of an adven -  ture, they get more freedom in their choices than NPCs. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 123  u sin G   s kills   to   i nflict   s train  Many characters have special talents or abilities that  allow them to inflict strain on a target. However, every -  one can default to making a social skill check as an  action in order to inflict strain. If they succeed, they  inflict 1 strain, plus 1 additional strain per uncanceled  󲊳 . If they fail, they suffer 2 strain.  Remember, the social skill check your character uses  needs to be appropriate to the situation and their goals.  Your character can’t use Coercion when they’re trying  to charm and flatter someone, for example. Also, it’s  never enough to just roll some dice: you always need to  explain what your character is doing and why the check  makes sense. It can be enough to say “my character is  complimenting the target’s appearance, so I’m going to  make a Charm check,” but you do have to explain your  character’s actions.  Further, and this should go without saying, you can’t  use weapons or combat checks to inflict strain in a  social encounter. Once your character starts throwing  punches, the time for talk is over.  u sing   M otivations   in   s o C ial   e n C ounters  M otivations are a big part of anybody’s character, so  we expect them to come into play throughout a  game session. That’s certainly true in social encounters.  These rules apply to all characters, both PC and NPC, so  they matter for players and GMs.  i ncrease   or   D ecrease   y our   c hances  Engaging with a target’s Motivation is one of the most  common ways for your character to increase their odds  of success in a social encounter. Likewise, working  against a target’s Motivation makes failure more likely  for your character.  A   simple   and   effective   way   to   represent   those  increased odds of success or failure is through adding  󲊸   or   󲊸   to a skill check. Let’s talk about adding   󲊸   to  your character’s check first.  When your character is able to work with a target’s  Strength or Flaw, your character adds   󲊸   to their next  social skill check targeting that character. By “work -  ing with,” we mean working some reference to that  Strength or Flaw into what your character says or  does, or simply choosing words or an action that plays  on those Motivation facets.  If your character is able to work with the target’s Fear  or Desire, the effect is the same, but amplified: add  󲊸   󲊸 . Fears and Desires are powerful Motivation facets  that govern many of a character’s choices, so playing to  them can have a greater effect.  “ C riti C al   r e M arks   ”   in   s o C ial   e n C ounters  In combat, your character can inflict and suf -  fer Critical Injuries from particularly powerful  or lucky blows. In social encounters, the same  thing can happen when someone makes a par -  ticularly good point, powerful argument, or  painful insult.  One way we represent this is by allowing all  characters to inflict “critical remarks” in a social  encounter. They do this the same way they inflict  a Critical Injury in combat: by spending   󲊵   and  󲊴 . In this case, when a character makes a social  check, they can spend   󲊵   or   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   to inflict  5 strain on the target.  The player controlling the PC or NPC (you or  your GM) also has to come up with some idea  of what the remark, argument, or insult was and  why it had such a powerful effect. EXAMPLE: USING STRENGTH AND FLAWS  For example, let’s take Katrina’s character Akiko, the  renegade clone (see page   46 ). Akiko’s Strength  is independence, and her Flaw is intolerance (in  this case, of other clones). Akiko is at a fancy din -  ner party when she’s approached by the host (an  NPC controlled by the GM). The host wants to get  on Akiko’s good side so that he can ask her for a  favor later. If he wants to play to Akiko’s Strength,  he might compliment her on her wealth and finan -  cial independence. If, instead, he wants to play to  the clone’s Flaw, he might make some disparaging  comment about how dull and uninteresting most  other clones are. Both of these are attempts to use  the Charm skill to influence Akiko (and both add  󲊸   to the subsequent skill check). However, narra -  tively, both are very different approaches. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 124  However, sometimes your character’s approach are  going to work against an opponent’s Motivation. This  most likely happens because your character isn’t aware  of their target’s Motivations. By “working against,” we  mean making some reference to the Motivation during  an interaction that rubs the target the wrong way, or  simply conflicts with the Motivation.  As we illustrate in our previous example, when your  character works against a target’s Strength or Flaw, your  character adds   󲊸   to their next social skill check against  that target. When your character works against the tar -  get’s Desire or Fear, they add   󲊸   󲊸   to their next social  skill check against that target.  D iscernin G   o ther   c haracters ’   m otivations  Discerning another character’s Motivations can give  your character a major advantage in a social encounter.  Generally, your character accomplishes this through  spending   󲊴   or   󲊵   on skill checks (see page   121 ). This  is the way we recommend learning Motivations, since  it’s a logical way to spend these resources in a social  encounter, and it encourages characters to interact with  each other.  However, if you want to have your character study  their target and try to discern one of the target’s Moti -  vations that way, your GM could allow you to make an  opposed Perception versus Cool check   (represent -  ing the target’s ability to maintain an even tone and  neutral affectation, and not let their internal thoughts  tinge their words or demeanor). If you are successful,  your GM can let your character learn one of the target’s  Motivation facets.  Keep in mind, however, that if your character does  this, they’ll be spending time in the social encounter  quietly but intently studying the target character, some -  thing that probably isn’t going to escape notice. Basi -  cally, it’s not a good approach if your character is trying  to be subtle. Also, the GM should only let your charac -  ter attempt this once or twice per encounter, and only  once per target. EXAMPLE: USING DESIRES AND FEARS  Going back to our example, let’s say the host tries to  play on Akiko’s Desire for knowledge, specifically  any information about her creation. He suggests that  he has purchased some top-secret data concerning  the cloning process. Or perhaps the host wants to  play on Akiko’s Fear of isolation. He makes some  conciliatory comments about how hard it must be to  be an individual who shares the same face as count -  less other clones, and on the effort Akiko makes to  look visually distinct. Again, these are different nar -  rative approaches, but they result in the same Charm  skill check (adding   󲊸   󲊸   to the pool). EXAMPLE: WORKING AGAINST MOTIVATIONS  Revisiting our example, let’s say that when our  host approaches Akiko, he suggests that she re -  ally needs his help to escape the authorities. This  conflicts with Akiko’s Strength of independence,  and she won’t react well to the idea that she needs  anyone’s help. Or perhaps he wants to hire Akiko  for a job posing as an “ordinary” clone again. He  doesn’t realize it, but this is going to play against  Akiko’s Fear of being lost in the “sea of sameness.”  In the first case, the host must add   󲊸   to his Charm  check. In the second, he adds   󲊸   󲊸 .  d eter M ining   np C M otivations  For those of you who are Game Masters, Motivations  can present a bit of a challenge. This is due to the sheer  number of NPCs that you’re managing. Just figuring  out Motivations for every NPC would be an impossible  task, not to mention remembering all of them! For this  reason, we have a few suggestions for GMs as to the  best way to manage NPC Motivations.  Ignore minion Motivations:   In a movie, minions  would be the extras. Anyone important enough that  their Motivations matter should not be a minion.  Minor characters only have Strengths and Flaws:  This applies to any character your group is going to  interact with once or twice at the most. Don’t worry  about their deeper Desires or Fears. Strengths and  Flaws are good cues for how to roleplay the NPC so  that your group can interact with them.  Improvise Motivations:   Since your players can  only learn NPC Motivations by spending resources  or deliberately trying to discover them, don’t be  afraid to improvise Motivations for minor NPCs  on the spot as needed instead of determining them  beforehand. You can roll on one of the tables in  Chapter 2: Creating Characters , or you can just  make something up! The important thing is to give  something for your group to work with.  In the end, you should only determine all four Moti -  vations facets ahead of time for NPCs who are going  to be recurring characters in your adventures. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 125  CHAPTER 8: THE GAME MASTER  S o, you and your friends decided you wanted to play  Genesys , and for one of any number of reasons, you  ended up being the   Game Master. What do you do now?  We assume you’ve already read through the basic rules, so  you know how our game works. But being a good Game  Master (or GM) takes a lot more than that. This section is  going to walk you through some of the basics of being a  GM, and specifically a good GM, when playing our game.  g a M ing   the   s yste M  O r more accurately, game mastering the system. The  Narrative Dice System offers an incredible amount  of flexibility throughout the players’ adventures. This  section provides guidelines, tips, and tricks to help  you, as the GM, manage those adventures and get the  most out of the system. For ideas on developing stories,  building campaigns, or planning adventures, see   Part  III: Game Master’s Toolkit , starting on page 189.  The Narrative Dice System offers GMs a lot of  resources to work with. These resources reduce pre -  game preparation time, provide rich opportunities  for storytelling, and make your role fun and easy. You  should enjoy the adventures as much as everyone else!  t he   m ost   i mportant   t hin G  As the GM, your goal is to make sure everyone is enjoy -  ing the experience and having fun. Just like each and  every other player, you’ve taken time out of a busy  schedule to get together and play a game, tell a story,  and enjoy each other’s company.  If someone isn’t having fun, the GM is the player best  suited to fix things. And the Narrative Dice System pro -  vides a lot of ways to do just that.  r ule   z ero  If having fun is the most important thing, then “Rule Zero”  is the most important tool the GM has to work with. Rule  Zero is a concept that has been around since roleplaying  first began, often assumed but not always clearly stated.  Rule Zero means the GM has the power to change  whatever needs to be changed for the benefit of the  story or the player experience.  Rule Zero can take many forms. If a game rule is  more nuisance than helpful, don’t use it. If a situation  starts to derail, set it back on its course. If you don’t like  the outcome after a particular dice roll, rules call, or  previous decision, change it. While everyone is playing  the game together, as the GM, you are the director and  producer, and you have say over the final cut and edits.  This is a pretty powerful concept, and it should be  used carefully. Be careful to avoid arbitrary or ran -  dom use of Rule Zero to completely rewrite history on  a whim or force things to unfold exactly the way you  want. If you abuse Rule Zero, the players may not feel  their actions are meaningful or that their choices have  consequences. But applied at the right time, Rule Zero  can help speed up play, resolve arguments, and keep the  focus on the story and having fun.  For example, if you can’t remember the specific rules  for a situation that doesn’t come up often, instead of  stopping the flow of the story to search for something  in a book, you might say, “I can’t remember the exact  rule, but here’s how we’re going to handle it this time—  we can look it up after the session for next time.”  a warding   e xperien C e   p oints  a fter   e a C h   s ession  One of the fun things about RPGs is how char -  acters grow and improve over time. We do this  by awarding experience at the end of each game  session. Players receive this experience, and then  can spend it to improve their characters.  At the end of a 3-5 hour game session, we rec -  ommend you give each of your players 20 XP. If  you want your players to improve their charac -  ters more quickly, you can increase that to 25,  and likewise if you want slower improvements,  you can drop that to 15 XP per session. Shorter  sessions should also award 5 less XP, while lon -  ger sessions can award 5 more XP. We explain  how to spend that experience on page   44 . Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 126  b efore   p lay   b egins  T o get the most out of the entire play experience—  from a single session to an entire campaign—there  are several steps you can take with the players to ensure  everyone is having fun. Taking time at the outset can  save time down the road and can prevent a number of  issues before they can even start.  s ocial   c ontract  Every day, we follow a social contract whether at work  or at play, often without even knowing it. Social con -  tracts are simply the written and unwritten rules of  acceptable conduct and behavior in different situations  or environments—like when gaming with a group of  friends, for example.  Many groups don’t specifically talk about social  contracts or acceptable behavior. A certain behavior  is assumed based on the situation, or potential con -  flicts and issues are rare. However, talking about game  behavior and guidelines up front ensures everyone is  on the same page and that you are playing in a welcom -  ing environment that is enjoyable for everyone.  b ehavior   G   ui D elines  Behavior directly impacts the player experience. What  one player considers edgy or fun another may consider  rude and insensitive. Sorting this out beforehand is better  than having something occur during a session where feel -  ings may be hurt or players become frustrated or angry.  Whether you discuss this with your players in per -  son or through email, everyone should understand the  expectations or guidelines that need to be respected.  This also gives a player the opportunity to back out  gracefully if it’s not the sort of social environment in  which they would feel comfortable and have fun.  You might consider discussing some of the following  questions with your players:  •   Is swearing and adult language acceptable? If you  were to assign a movie rating, a PG game environ -  ment would handle swearing and sexual innuendo  in a completely different way than a group com -  fortable with a more mature, R-rated setting.  •   What is your cell phone policy? This applies to  phones,   tablets,   laptops,   and   other   electronic  devices that distract people throughout the day.  Should people turn their phones off? Step outside  if they need to take or make a call? What about  checking email, status updates, or messages? You  may want to consider some regularly scheduled  breaks to allow players to check their phones.  •   Is smoking allowed? What about alcohol? These  two guidelines can be serious deal breakers for  some players, and the answers may differ based on  where you are playing.  •   Is eating allowed at the table? Gaming doesn’t  always revolve around a physical table, but some  people are leery about having food and beverages  around their gaming stuff, while others view gam -  ing as a more casual, social event where offering  food may be the best way to get everyone together.  •   Are certain topics or themes off-limits? Everyone  has a different level of tolerance toward the events  that bombard us in the news every day. Some  people may be comfortable with playing in games  that involve aspects of racism, sexism, oppression,  abuse, or particular forms of violence. For other  people, however, certain topics may make them  feel uncomfortable or vulnerable. People who have  experienced highly traumatic events may have  trouble if similar issues come at them without  warning in the game. It can be helpful to give play -  ers a chance to privately ask for certain topics to be  off-limits or to be given warning if those topics are  going to come up, so that such issues won’t end up  accidentally derailing a game session.  m in D fulness   m atters  Discussing these issues and questions are great oppor -  tunities not only to establish a safe, comfortable envi -  ronment, but also to help the players get to know one  another better. This can be especially useful if the group  is relatively new, or when new players are invited to join  an established group. Just remember that some play -  ers may want to discuss sensitive issues privately, so be  sure they have a chance to do so as well.  Knowing a bit more about each other, the players are  better prepared to work together as a team, have each  others’ backs, and ensure everyone is having fun. Each  player is responsible for their own behavior, but it may  fall to the GM (or the host player) to remind everyone  about these guidelines.  f un   for   a ll  The bottom line is to make sure everyone is having fun  and feels involved. It’s hard to have fun in the game if  you don’t feel comfortable while playing it. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 127  s ettin G   the   s ta G e  While social contracts manage behaviors and expecta -  tions outside of the game, there are also a number of  considerations that impact what goes on inside the game.  p layer   p articipation  Everyone should be encouraged to participate during a  session. This applies to both the player and the charac -  ters they control in-game. Each group features a unique  mix of personality types. Sometimes having introverts  and extroverts gaming together can introduce some  potentially awkward moments. In particular, there are  three game-related behaviors to consider.  •   Speaking for other players or characters.   Play -  ers should be allowed to voice their opinions, offer  ideas, and manage their own characters. Someone  may ask for suggestions or advice, but one player  should not dictate or direct another player’s actions  at the table without permission.  •   Dice etiquette.   People love dice, which are the heart  of the Narrative Dice System. Some players are very  protective of their dice. Someone should not use  another player’s dice or make a skill check or impor -  tant roll for another player without permission.  •   Resolving outcomes.   Genesys   offers countless  ways to resolve and describe nearly any task a char -  acter may attempt. Someone might think they have  the perfect way to interpret or explain another  player’s dice rolls, but players tend to enjoy having  a level of personal control over the story—espe -  cially how it relates to their own character. Again,  players may seek suggestions or advice, but other -  wise, one player should not mandate or dictate dice  results for others. This includes the GM!  p layer   C hara C ter   C reation  W hen it comes to creating characters for a game,  whether for shorter adventures or longer-term  campaigns, consider how player characters should be  created. Two of the main considerations are:  •   Do the players build their characters as a group or  individually?  •   Is character information public or private knowledge?  There are no right or wrong answers to these ques -  tions, but they can have a significant impact on the  game’s mood or player interactions.  c haracter   b uil D in G  If players build their characters individually, you may  end up with an incredibly wide range of character con -  cepts with skills or abilities you hadn’t considered—  while running the risk that players might duplicate roles  or create concepts that don’t mesh well with the setting  or direction of the story. Creating characters individually  lets players personalize backgrounds and Motivations  without worrying how they fit with the other characters.  Building characters together allows the group to  fill specific roles, make sure a wide range of skills and  abilities are covered, collaborate on why the characters  are adventuring together, and establish relationships  or backgrounds that connect them to each other. The  trade-off is that players may find themselves sticking  to previously played character concepts or established  archetypes for a particular setting—the fighter, the dip -  lomat, the support person, etc.  What drives the story and these characters? Are  they a group of strangers learning how to cope with  each other? Or do the characters know each other and  already work well together? Are they a ragtag collection  of misfits? A hand-selected task force? How your play -  ers create their characters, whether individually or as a  group, can help set the tone for the adventures to come.  p ersonal   k no W le DG e  In the game, each character has a unique background,  personality, mix of relationships, Motivations, hopes,  and dreams. Some of these may not be known at the  outset and develop over the course of play. However,  it’s important to decide just how much the characters—  and their players—know about each other.  Characters with a secret background or hidden agenda  can provide some great storytelling opportunities, but  who else knows about it? Will some characters have  access to this personal information that others do not?  This applies to the players as well. Some groups pre -  fer to have secret information remain secret, to add  a sense of mystery or allow a surprise turn of events.  Others would rather let all players in on the “secret”  so they can enjoy both sides of the story, while making  sure their characters do not act on any secret informa -  tion they wouldn’t have access to.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 128  p reparation   t ips  G enesys   makes it easy for you to prepare for a game  session, offering a number of quick tips and tricks  to help you get ready. Game prep does not need to be a  long, complex task. It can often be done with just a bit  of time and something for taking notes, such as a pad of  paper, some index cards, or a text program on a tablet.  b ullet   p oints  Spend some time highlighting key events, topics, or  outcomes from previous sessions, as well as any notes  on what you want to include or keep an eye out for  during the next session. An easy way to do this is by  making a series of short bullet points that summarize  these thoughts.  A recap of the previous session can be as simple as not -  ing the three most important events that took place and  asking the players if they feel anything else stands out that  should be mentioned. You don’t need an exhaustive list  or paragraphs of information; the highlights are sufficient.  You might want to maintain a list of key events, char -  acters, or locations that come up during the campaign,  adding new details as they develop. Even if you can’t  remember every single detail, the bullet points cover the  most important ones. Don’t forget that the players can  always help fill in the blanks, if necessary.  r emin D ers   an D   n otes  Manage your notes using whatever format you are com -  fortable with, whether physical or digital. You can also  write yourself reminders—things not to forget, people  making an appearance, or possibly the consequences for  certain actions the characters may take. As these notes  are used or reminders have triggered, the GM can put  the cards away, cross off comments, or delete items.  For especially important reminders, consider setting  a timer. Cell phones and mobile devices are great tools  for this; you can set a timer and have your notes pop  up in a message or alert, right in front of you when you  need them. If you’re not GMing digitally, a timer can  remind you to pull up an index card with key notes,  open an envelope filled with important handouts, or  flip to that page you bookmarked earlier.  npc   r oll   c all  Take a moment to consider any non-player characters  (NPCs) the player characters may encounter over the  course of a session. Are there key villains or important  people in the story? Will the group face off against an  assassin, dangerous monster, or mysterious stranger?  NPCs can be important to add to a list of bullet points  or reminders. The GM can write down their names and  think about how they may appear or act during a ses -  sion. Adding a detail or two about each can make these  NPCs memorable. The assassin bears a scar, the monster  is cloaked in mist, or the stranger has a foreign accent.  During the session, those notes are then at hand just  in case that NPC comes into play. With a bullet list, you  can cross off NPCs that have already served their pur -  pose, or add details to a minor NPC the players sud -  denly latch onto who becomes a recurring character.  If there is a main antagonist in the story, don’t forget  to consider their plans and machinations. Even if the  player characters never encounter this adversary face-  to-face, the actions the players take still have an impact.  Do they foil plans? Set into motion a dangerous chain  of events? Gain a new, as-yet-unknown enemy? Think -  ing about the antagonist’s actions and goals beforehand  and taking a few quick notes during play may be all you  need to keep them involved in the story.  np C s   and   s kills  Even if an NPC is in a combat encounter or has  important skills, you don’t need to have a full stat  block memorized. As a rule of thumb, make note  of one or two key stats and assume everything else  is average. For example, a street enforcer may have  Brawn 4 and a Melee skill of 2. Then for simplic -  ity, you can assume all the other characteristics  are average (2) and all other skills are untrained.  For more important NPCs, like adversaries and  nemeses (see page   131 ), you may wish to create  full character stats. You should use the guidelines  on page   202   that explain how to build adversaries.  Some NPCs fall in between these two catego -  ries. To quickly manage an NPC on the spot, you  can choose which player character that NPC is  most like and use that PC’s stats and abilities as  a baseline. Once you’re familiar with the PCs,  you won’t even need to look at their character  sheet—or can get the information you need with  a quick glance across the table. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Cold enough that it impairs the  characters by providing a   󲊸 ? Or so dangerously cold  that   󲊸   󲊸   or more are added?   󲊸   and   󲊸   help establish  the magnitude of an effect.  When players describe their PCs’ actions or make  interesting plans, you can reward this by providing   󲊸   to  represent the impact and importance of different parts of  their descriptions. Similarly,   󲊸   reinforce the severity of  disruptive or distracting conditions.  s tory   p oints  You can show the importance of a situation or the  power of an adversary by using Story Points. Spend -  ing a Story Point establishes a certain tension or raising  of the stakes. For example, spending a Story Point to  upgrade an NPC combat check shows that the situa -  tion calls for extra effort or special emphasis. Things  feel less arbitrary when a cost has been paid (by spend -  ing a Story Point) to help achieve the effect.  Feel free to use Story Points liberally. Not only do  Story Points allow you to upgrade dice or trigger key  events and abilities, but each time you use a Story  Point, it puts a Story Point back in the hands of the PCs.  m otivation  Few things motivate a character better than their own  self-interest. Having a Motivation can create an imme -  diate relationship, often with some sort of cause-and-  effect impact. If you owe money to a loan shark, they’re  going to want it back. If you’re motivated to protect  your family, they reach out to you in their time of need.  If you want to get rich, you’re going to want to call in  any favors owed, preferably in the form of money.  Bringing up a Motivation can help your players feel  that their characters have a connection to the game  world and that things happen offscreen. More goes on  in the story than just what’s described during a session.  s train  Characters get battered and bruised in more ways than  physical injury. Strain represents stress, fatigue, despera -  tion, worry, lack of focus, or being pushed to the limit.  Since characters recover from strain quickly, you can have  them suffer strain liberally to reflect these situations.  If a character hasn’t slept in a while, they might suffer  a certain amount of strain until they get a good night’s  rest. If the player wants to push their character to get  just “a little bit more” out of an action, you might rule  that they can do it if they’re willing to suffer 2 strain.  Minor injuries and inconveniences such as twisting  an ankle or falling out of a tree are better resolved with  strain instead of wounds. Strain is also a great general-  purpose use for extra   󲊴   or   󲊱   during skill checks, and  can be described in a way that fits almost any situation.  i nitiative  The Initiative system is flexible, but it can feel even more  dynamic when you adjust the order of characters in a  scene. Perhaps due to long delays in their planning or as  an added effect of a terrible roll, you move a PC Initia -  tive slot down a slot or two. If the NPCs become highly  motivated or you have a   󲊵   to spend, you might decide to  move an NPC slot higher in the Initiative order. Changing  the order in which characters act can affect their decision-  making or prompt them to rethink their strategies.  e xperience   p oints  Awarding experience points is covered on page   125 ,  and it is another powerful resource. Receiving experi -  ence points during pivotal moments, upon unraveling  a mystery, or after defeating a powerful enemy gives  players a tangible sense of accomplishment. Provid -  ing small bonuses here and there can also be used to  reward clever play, neat ideas, or excellent roleplaying.  t ime   an D   t imin G  Having time pass is one way to help a game seem more  real.

Saying a character is injured but that they are  ready to head back into action the day after a Medi -  cine check creates a very different feeling than saying it  takes days—or even weeks—to recover.  Player and character actions can have time-related  consequences as well. If players delay making deci -  sions, it could reflect uncertainty in their characters  and make certain character actions take longer to  accomplish. Poor planning, causing scenes in public,  or a   󲊲   result on a check might give an enemy the time  they need to slip away. Tampering with time by hav -  ing an action take longer or resolve more quickly than  expected is also a great use for   󲊴   and   󲊱 .  To create a sense of tension, you can take time away  from the characters. The PCs have only moments to  prepare before meeting an important diplomat. They  thought they had a month to recover the stolen paint -  ing, but their contact demands it by the end of the week.  They are ambushed by an enemy. Limiting time can  force the players’ hands, trigger a sense of urgency, or  create a spark of excitement if things start to drag.  t he   n arrative   d i C e  T hese special dice are a key feature of the game. They  provide a wide range of possible outcomes, making  each roll of the dice unique. The   Narrative dice offer a  lot of opportunity for enhancing the story with a deeper  narrative, but they won’t get in the way when you want  to focus on fast-paced action.  G et   e veryone   i nvolve D  As the GM, you may feel a certain responsibility to  describe the outcome every time dice are rolled. But you  don’t need to take this on by yourself—get all the players  involved! Everyone is there to have a good time and tell  a story, and sometimes ideas other players come up with  fit perfectly or offer options you hadn’t even considered.  Each player should be encouraged to describe their  actions. The reason behind the dice roll (hacking a  computer, negotiating with an alien species, climbing  a sheer cliff face) often suggests a number of possible  outcomes, consequences, or side effects. Hacking a  computer could involve a lot of things: you might be  thinking about how quickly the computer gets hacked,  while another player describes the amount of data they  get, and another mentions inserting their own special  subroutine to track other users, or… you get the idea.  The more creative minds involved, the more interesting  options available.  Generally the person making the roll offers their  ideas first, and if the ideas sound sensible, you might  go along with them. If the player is struggling, or you  want to hint at a possible outcome the players would  find desirable, getting the other players involved is also  very valuable.  This applies to your own dice rolls as well. You don’t  need to control every aspect of the outcome when you  roll the dice. If you end up with more   󲊴   than you have  ideas for using, ask the players for help. If the dice roll  results in something bad happening to the PCs, let the  players come up with a number of ways their plans might  have gone wrong or offer various worst-case scenarios.  i nterpretin G   s ymbols   an D   c olors  Since each die goes into the dice pool for a specific  reason, you can use that information when narrating  a check’s outcome. If a player gains a Boost die   󲊸   for  planning ahead, and they end up succeeding because of  that   󲊸 , then you know it’s because they planned ahead  and can use that when describing the outcome.  Keep this in mind when determining the success or  failure of a given roll. As you cancel symbols out to see  if you have at least one net   󲊳 , you can even narrate  what the cancellations reflect.  Imagine a character is climbing down a sheer cliff  at night. The cliff is slick with water and overlooks an  ancient temple far below. The PC needs to make a skill  check, and you decide it is a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Athlet -  ics check . There are far more possible outcomes than  simply succeeding or failing, and you can do more than  just describing why success or failure occurs. In this  case, let’s assume the character succeeds.  If one or more   󲊳   appear on the Proficiency dice   󲊻 ,  while the Setback dice   󲊸   you assigned for climbing  down a slippery slope and darkness have   󲊱 , you could  describe the scene this way: Despite the slippery conditions, your training  and experience in climbing help you navigate your  way down. While it’s dark outside, the moon pro -  vides just enough light to help you find handholds  and keep your footing. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 131  If the   󲊳   appear on the   󲊸   you assigned for planning  ahead and the assistance of another character, while   󲊰  appear on the   󲊻 , the scene may be described like this:  In both cases, the skill check was a success, using  the same dice and with the same results, but choosing  which dice to reference in your description influenced  how the scene unfolded.  D   ynamic   D   ice  As you narrate scenes and describe situations, you can  reinforce the details or drive home a point by physically  adding or removing dice as details come up.  Imagine the cliff-climbing scene described above. As  you set up the scene, you describe how steep the cliff  is as you push forward three Difficulty dice   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 .  Adding a a Setback die   󲊸 , you mention how the nearby  waterfall creates a fine mist, leaving the cliff face wet  and slippery. Finally, you remind the players that the  PCs got lost on the way and arrived in the dark of night,  and you push forward a second   󲊸 .  You could easily describe the scene first, then assemble  a dice pool afterward. But associating details with specific  dice helps create a richer context. The mist is a nice touch,  but adding a die with the description tells the players the  mist is thick enough to leave the cliff face slippery.  When you say it’s dark outside, there could be a wide  range of answers to “How dark is it?” Dark enough to  warrant a Setback die   󲊸   tells players it’s dark enough to  impact the scene. Or maybe it’s really dark and you add  two Setback dice   󲊸   󲊸 , making it feel much harder to  see or navigate than just one Setback die.  The same can be done when assigning positive dice.  Adding dice while describing actions and scenes is a  great way to reinforce important details and encourage  creative, descriptive play.  a dversaries  A s a GM, one of your major jobs is running the vari -  ous non-player characters that your group’s PCs  encounter throughout their adventures. Many of these  NPCs are going to be so minor to the story that they only  merit a brief description. However, you’re going to have  plenty of NPCs who play a bigger role in your game.  We use the name   adversaries   to describe these more  important NPCs. Basically, adversaries are NPCs impor -  tant enough to have a profile of their characteristics and  skills. Even if an NPC isn’t adversarial to your group, if  they have a profile, it’s because we figure they’re impor -  tant enough to be targeted by skill checks or make checks  of their own. These are the same guidelines you should  use when figuring out which of your NPCs need profiles.  a D versary   p rofiles  Think of an adversary profile as a stripped-down ver -  sion of one of your player characters’ profiles. The goal  is the same—to let the adversary function within the  framework of   Genesys ’s rules—even if the adversary’s  rules are a lot simpler than the PC rules. In   Genesys ,  there are three types of adversary profiles. We call those  three types minions, rivals, and nemeses.  m inions  Minions are the most common NPCs in most games.  As their name implies, minions are faceless individu -  als who provide the numbers to bulk out encoun -  ters.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 132  criminal enforcers, and a gathering of angry citizens are  all examples of groups of minions. If you think of your  game in movie terms, minions are extras the heroes or  villains deal with to show how powerful they are.  We designed minions to only be a major threat in  numbers; a single minion shouldn’t prove too dangerous  to most PCs. However, your players aren’t going to con -  front minions on their own very often. Minions operate  in small groups to increase their effectiveness. This allows  you to populate your encounters with lots of NPCs with -  out bogging down the game with tracking or rolling dice  for each NPC individually. Because they work in groups,  you only need to track what the group is doing.  You don’t have to deploy minions in groups, of course.  Just remember that they’re going to be fairly incompe -  tent if you don’t, unless they have high characteristics.  h o W   D   an G erous   a re   t hey   ?  A single minion is a negligible threat to a PC, unless the  PC is significantly impaired, heavily wounded, or other -  wise weakened. However, a group of two or three minions  should be a reasonable threat for a single starting PC, and  a group of three to four should be a reasonable threat for  a PC who has spent at least an additional 100 XP.  If you extrapolate that out, two groups of two or three  minions should be a reasonable threat for a starting  party, and two groups of three to four minions should  be a reasonable threat for a party of PCs who have  spent at least 100 XP. However, make sure you review  the minion profiles! Minions with soak values of 5 or  higher, wound thresholds of 7 or higher, or weapons  that do 9 or more damage increase that threat level  from reasonable to very challenging.  m inion   r ules  Minions have several unique rules that reflect their sta -  tus as disposable adversaries.  •   Unless otherwise specified, minions do not suffer  strain.   Anything that normally inflicts strain inflicts  wounds on a minion instead. Minions also can -  not voluntarily suffer strain. This means that when  a minion is taken out of combat due to exceeding  their wound threshold, it is up to you whether the  minion was incapacitated or killed, depending on  the circumstances. (It also means that minions can  be taken out of a social encounter for exceeding  their wound threshold due to suffering strain. You  should play this as you would play a non-minion  NPC in the same situation, not by having a minion  spontaneously drop dead at the grand ball!)  •   Minions do not possess skills.   One thing that  makes minions significantly weaker than your PCs  is their lack of skills. They can compensate for this  by operating as a group. A minion’s profile lists sev -  eral skills in which that minion type gains ranks  when acting as a group.  •   Minions can fight as a group.   As noted previously,  you do not have to deploy minions as groups.  However, deploying them in a group has several  advantages. It simplifies combat and makes min -  ions more dangerous while allowing you to include  large numbers of NPCs in encounters. You only  deploy minions of the same type in a single group.  •   A minion group has a single wound threshold,  shared by all members of that group.   A minion  group’s wound threshold is equal to the sum of the  wound thresholds of every member of the group. (For  example, a group of three street toughs, each with a  wound threshold of 4, has a wound threshold of 12.)  Each time any member of the group suffers wounds,  you apply the wounds to the group’s wound thresh -  old. Individual members of the group are defeated  one at a time, each time the total wounds suffered  exceeds a group member’s share of the group’s wound  threshold. For example, when the street tough group  exceeds 4 wounds, one street tough is defeated.  •   When characters attack a group, they attack the  group as a whole, not an individual.   Narratively  you may describe them as attacking an individual,  but mechanically they’re attacking the group.  •   Working as a group also allows minions to use  skills.   A minion group gains one skill rank for each  member of the group beyond the first, as long as the  skill is on the minion’s profile. So, our group of three  street toughs would count as having two ranks (for  the two toughs after the first) in any skill checks the  group makes for skills listed on their profile.  •   Critical Injuries kill minions.   If a minion suffers a  Critical Injury, it is immediately incapacitated. If a  group of minions suffers a Critical Injury, it suffers  one minion’s worth of wounds plus one (so that  one of the minions in the group is incapacitated).  r ivals  Rivals are more dangerous than minions but usually less  powerful than a PC. Most of your named NPCs should  be rivals: characters important enough to have a person -  ality and some meaningful interactions with your PCs.  We designed rivals to be simplified versions of player  characters. Unlike minions, they operate alone, and they  have skills just like PCs do. Generally, we expect them to  be about as skilled as a starting player character, so they  probably don’t have more than two ranks in a single skill  (exceptions can and do exist, of course). Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

h o W   D   an G erous   a re   t hey   ?  A single rival should be reasonably dangerous for a sin -  gle PC, so your party should find an equal number of  rivals to be a reasonably dangerous threat. More rivals  should generally equate to more danger, and if your  group outnumbers the number of rivals they face, the  threat should be more manageable.  Even more than with minions, the threat of a rival  can vary greatly depending on their stats. Rivals with  soak values of 5 or higher, wound thresholds of 14 or  higher, three or more ranks in combat or social skills  (depending on the type of encounter), or weapons that  do 9 or more damage increase that threat level from  reasonable to very challenging. In cases like these, a  rival may prove a reasonable threat to two of your PCs.  r ival   r ules  Rivals follow most of the same rules as player charac -  ters, except as noted here.  •   Rivals suffer Critical Injuries normally.   How -  ever, when a rival exceeds their wound thresh -  old, they can be  killed outright (instead of incapacitated) at your  discretion.   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury Result ,  on page   115 , is designed to not kill player charac -  ters easily, but often when it comes to NPCs, you’re  going to want to be able to eliminate them once  they’re no longer a threat.  •   Rivals cannot suffer strain.   Anything that nor -  mally inflicts strain inflicts an equivalent number  of wounds on rivals instead. Rivals can use abili -  ties or invoke effects that inflict strain on the user;  this simply causes them to suffer wounds instead.  Remember, because they do not suffer strain, they  cannot recover from it, either. As with minions, if  a rival is incapacitated due to suffering strain, you  can rule on whether they were killed or rendered  unconscious based on the circumstances.  n emeses  The nemesis is the player character’s opposite num -  ber. Nemeses are, well, nemeses, and thus identical to  PCs in pretty much every respect. They may even be  more powerful; this is necessary to ensure that they can  pose a threat to an entire party. Nemeses often  possess talents, have high ranks in  skills   and   characteristics,   and  even have unique abilities.  Nemeses   suffer   strain   and  wounds normally, and they do  not have any special rules gov -  erning their operations by default.  There are some special rules for nem -  eses that you can choose to adopt in  Part III: Game Master Toolkit ,  however.   Check   out   page  204   for more details.

GENESYS  Part I: The Rules 134  a dversary   p rofile  O verall, we’ve kept adversary profiles in the various  setting sections, since adversaries are going to vary  wildly from setting to setting. However, we’ve provided  a couple of generic adversary profiles here, so that we  can go over each section of the adversary profile in turn.  •   Name:   The adversary’s name or type, plus whether  they are a minion, rival, or nemesis.  •   Description:   A brief description of the adversary.  •   Characteristics:   The ratings of the adversary’s six  basic characteristics.  •   Soak, Defense, and Thresholds:   These are the  adversary’s soak, their melee and ranged defense  values, and their wound and strain thresholds.  Only nemeses have strain thresholds.  •   Skills:   The skills (if any) that the adversary pos -  sesses. If the adversary is a minion, these skills only  apply when the adversary is in a group (and we add  the “group only” reminder text to the entry).  •   Talents:   The talents (if any) the adversary possesses.  •   Abilities:   These are special abilities that are not  skills or talents. Many are unique to a specific  adversary or type of adversary.  •   Equipment:   This is the adversary’s equipment. The  entry only lists important equipment such as weap -  ons, armor, and vital pieces of gear. Items such as  clothing,   spare   change,   phones,   pocket-knives,  flashlights, and so forth (pretty much anything you  might throw in your own pocket without thinking  about it) are not listed. However, they can be pres -  ent if you think it makes sense. Any bonuses from  equipment are already added to the profile.  You should note that adversaries do not always follow  the same rules that player characters do. Our intention  is for the profiles to be easy for you to reference and  use during your game, so we tend to omit nonessen -  tial information. For example, some adversaries may  have equipment that would cause a similar PC to be  encumbered, but the adversaries don’t suffer penalties  for it. This lets us give an adversary the right equipment  (such as weapons or armor) to make them interesting  and diverse opponents. Perhaps the weapon they carry  is modified to weigh less, or perhaps they’re wearing a  backpack that we didn’t list on their profile.  We also never list talents like Grit, Toughened,  Enduring, or other talents that provide permanent stat  increases. We just modify a profile accordingly.  s treet   t ou G h   ( m inion   )  The street tough is one of the go-to villains of any set -  ting. These belligerent petty criminals are a reasonable  first opponent for your PCs to beat up without your  having to worry that they may kill the group by acci -  dent.

This  is a threat that makes your group feel challenged but is  unlikely to incapacitate anyone and is very unlikely to  defeat the entire group.  However, since   Genesys   uses a free-form charac -  ter leveling system, determining what is a reasonable  threat can be tricky. We have some advice that can  make figuring that out easier and applies to both social  and combat encounters.  t he   G   ol D en   r ule   :   e rr   on   the   s i D e   of   c aution  One thing to remember as the GM: it’s always better for  your PCs succeed with a crushing victory than to be  overwhelmed in a bitter defeat. To put it another way,  your players probably won’t care if they defeat an oppo -  nent without much effort, but they are going to care if  you wipe out all their characters.  So, when building encounters (especially before you  have a good idea of your group’s capabilities), don’t be  afraid to make the first couple fairly easy. If they are  combat encounters, put your group up against a sin -  gle minion group or a number of rivals less than the  number of PCs in your party. If the encounter is a  social encounter, have it be against an adversary with  no ranks in any social skills, and then use Story Points  to upgrade the ability of the adversary’s checks if things  seem to be going well for your PCs.  c omparin G   s kills   an D   c haracteristics  A good way to gauge an adversary’s strength versus your  characters’ is to compare the ranks they have in skills  and characteristics. For example, a starting character  likely has only one characteristic at rank 4, and the rest  at rank 3 or 2. Likewise, they probably have a couple of  skills at rank 2 and a couple more at rank 1. When you  choose an adversary for these characters, select one with  equal or lower characteristics and equal or lower skills.  This is especially important in social encounters,  where your PCs are often going to be making opposed  skill checks against the adversaries. This means that  if an adversary has high skills and characteristics, it  doesn’t just make them good at succeeding at their own  skill checks. It also means that any opposed checks tar -  geting them have a higher difficulty, too.  m inion   G   roup   s izes  When putting minions in an encounter, keep in mind  that the size of their group goes a long way toward  determining how dangerous the group is to your PCs.  This is most obvious in light of a minion group’s com -  bined wound threshold, but it’s probably more impor -  tant with regard to the skill checks they’ll be rolling.  First, let’s look at wound thresholds. Minions with  wound thresholds of 2–4 are the least dangerous,  because a single hit from a weapon with low damage  can eliminate a minion from the group, and every min -  ion eliminated makes the group less dangerous. Min -  ions with wound thresholds of 5–7 are more danger -  ous, because unless your PCs have a weapon that does  at least 9 damage, it is often going to take two hits to  eliminate a minion from the group. Minions seldom  have a wound threshold higher than 7, and one that  does probably should be a rival instead.  Now, let’s look at group sizes and skill checks.  Remember, a group’s size effectively determines its  ranks in a skill. To gauge how dangerous this makes  it, determine how many minions it will take to get the  dice pool for a particular skill to at least three   󲊷   and/  or   󲊻 . Once they have three Ability or Proficiency dice  in their pool, minion groups are much more likely to  succeed than fail when attacking a PC.  Finally, keep minion group sizes around two to four  individuals, and never more than five. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 136  N ow that you know the rules for playing   Genesys ,  let’s talk about the settings you can play in. Many  players find a roleplaying game’s setting to be just as inter -  esting as its rules, and sometimes more so. For that rea -  son, we designed   Genesys   to work in as many settings as  possible, and we included six of them as examples.  Creating a truly exhaustive list of settings would have  required a much larger book than this one, so we chose  six that we thought covered a wide range of options and  were all broadly appealing. Most of them (the   modern  day   setting being the obvious exception) also have  examples among Fantasy Flight Games’ own settings,  making it even easier for us to talk about them. These  example settings are not “complete,” but we intend for  them to give you a good starting point when designing  a setting for your own game.  W hat ’ s   in   t his   p art   of   the   b ook  Let’s go over what you’re going to find in this part of  the book:  •   Chapter 1: Fantasy.   In many variants, this setting  is one of the most popular settings in fiction (and  certainly in roleplaying games).  •   Chapter 2: Steampunk.   Mad science, invention,  and the spirit of adventure exemplify this setting.  •   Chapter 3: Weird War.   This setting takes historical  warfare and adds a dash of occult horror to make  it more interesting.  •   Chapter 4: Modern Day.   Playing in a modern set -  ting can be just as fun as playing in a fictional one.  •   Chapter 5: Science Fiction.   Generally taking place  in the future, these stories have a solid grounding  in scientific fact.  •   Chapter 6: Space Opera.   This type of sci-fi doesn’t  let the facts get in the way of a good story!  t he   s ettin G   W orksheet  On the next page, you can find our setting worksheet. As  we said before, our example settings aren’t complete set -  tings. Instead, we intend for them to be frameworks you  can use to build your own settings for your own games.  The worksheet has places to record the principle  information about your setting—both the descriptive  details and the setting-specific game mechanics. You  can photocopy it or get a copy from our website.  The worksheet should be enough for you to get  started and serves as a good reference for your players.  A word of warning, though.

CHAPTER 1:   FANTASY  M agic, monsters, heroic warriors, and evil over -  lords—fantasy has all the makings of a good  adventure. There’s a reason it’s the basis for so many  games and central to the roots of roleplaying.  Despite being instantly recognizable and familiar,  fantasy is an incredibly varied genre, with numerous  subdivisions. However you decide to style your fantasy  game,   Genesys ’s customizability makes it perfect for  tailoring to the game you want.  t ropes  S ince   you   are   read -  ing   an   RPG   rule -  book,   we’re   going   to  bet you’re familiar with  the   tropes   of   the   fantasy  genre. But whether you’re a  sword and sorcery aficionado  or your experience comes from  popular films or video games, a  quick refresher never hurts. Often,  the tropes of a setting or genre sink  into our minds, but we don’t always think about them  on a conscious level. Actively considering the common  aspects of fantasy and how you want to integrate them  into your campaign is a worthwhile exercise that’s bound  to pay off. Not only will you be prepared should some -  one ask you to describe your campaign, but awareness of  these tropes helps you determine what makes your  campaign unique.  Really, though, don’t be too  unique; one of the advantages of a fan -  tasy setting is its familiarity for so many players, even  those who have never played an RPG before. Without  delving into the details of your campaign setting, simply  recognizing it as a medieval-type fantasy world (which  is the assumption we’re going with) should allow most  players to jump right in with minimal briefing.  That said, here we’ve tried to encapsulate some of the  common tropes we believe help define a fantasy setting.  Still, we understand if you want to skip to the new char -  acter options and review this later. They’re on page   142 .  m a G ic  It’s quite possible that magic is the defining characteris -  tic of a fantasy setting. Even when they aren’t on Earth,  fantasy settings often approximate a historical period,  whether a medieval or far future one. Still, some fan -  tasy settings might be on a world with few recogniz -  able technological or cultural ties to real-life history.  Regardless, the constant among these radically varied  fantasy settings is magic, whatever name it goes by. The  addition of magic turns science fiction into science fan -  tasy, and historical fiction into historical fantasy.  Magic is a broad, nebulous term, yet most people  have a pretty good idea of what you mean as soon as it’s  mentioned. Even if you can’t define magic, you know Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 139  it when you see it. Fundamentally, magic is a force that  breaks what we think of as the natural rules of the uni -  verse. It may be wielded by wizards or occur on its own.  Magic allows humans to create fire from nothing, heal  fatal wounds in moments, read the thoughts of others,  control the elements, and accomplish pretty much any -  thing else you might think of.  m onsters  Monsters, in the literal sense—goblins, trolls, ghouls,  gorgons, dragons, and so on—are a staple of fantasy.  Entire books have been written on the subject of fan -  tasy monsters, often for the express purpose of includ -  ing them in fantasy games for PCs to fight! While you  might be able to run a fantasy game without the PCs  ever slaying a monster, the lack of dangerous creatures  would be one of the defining characteristics of such a  game. Often, fighting monsters is a primary objective  of heroes in fantasy stories, whether to protect a vil -  lage, claim a bounty, or simply get at the treasure the  monster’s guarding.  We’ve included profiles for a few monsters on page  146 , but you’re certain to need more. Fortunately, the  rules for creating NPCs, on page   202 , apply to fantas -  tical creatures of all types. Often, all it takes to make  a monster stand out is the addition of a single special  rule, or even just an interesting quality, to its attacks.  Of course, monsters in the figurative sense are also  common in fantasy, but we cover that under the   Good  and Evil   trope.  Q uests  Some games define a quest as, well, pretty much any -  thing your character tries to accomplish. While we  have no issue with this nomenclature, traditionally  speaking, a quest is something a bit more than fetch -  ing a potion for an NPC who can’t be bothered to  leave their house.  What we’re talking about is a quest in the original  sense: a journey, probably long and at the very least dan -  gerous, to achieve an important goal. With any quest  worthy of the name, lives—and often entire civilizations  or worlds—hang in the balance. The consequences for  failure might not entail simple destruction, but enslave -  ment at the hands of some evil entity or force. Likely,  the quest focuses on a particular object that must be  found, brought to a specific place, destroyed, or some  combination of the above. Any of this sounding famil -  iar? That object is called a MacGuffin.  t he   m ac G uffin  A MacGuffin is (quite literally, you could say) a plot  device. It’s an object that serves the primary, if not sole,  purpose of getting the protagonists engaged with the  plot and, likely, of keeping it moving. Really, a MacGuf -  fin can be a great tool for GMs to use in any game, but it’s  particularly relevant for the fantasy quest. Player charac -  ters might or might not be able to actually use a MacGuf -  fin, and they might not ever even lay eyes on it. Perhaps  the most famous MacGuffin is the Holy Grail of Arthu -  rian legend—the quest for which leads to all number of,  honestly, quite unrelated adventures. Regardless of the  form it takes, a MacGuffin gets the PCs embroiled in the  events that really constitute the adventure. The MacGuf -  fin may lose significance, fade into the background, turn  out not to exist, or even get successfully resolved. What’s  important is that it gets the protagonists caught up with  events and non-player characters compelling enough to  keep the heroes involved regardless.  G oo D   an D   e vil  Good and evil are distinct, black-and-white concepts.  More than mere ideas, good and evil are very real forces  in a traditional fantasy setting. Although heroes may  engage in some vices, and probably have weaknesses  of character, they are ultimately good, and oppose the  suffering of innocents at every turn. On the other end  of the spectrum, villains tend to be power hungry and  unambiguously evil; they may delight in causing mis -  ery for its own sake while concocting grandiose plans  to conquer or simply destroy. Fantasy worlds are shaped  by the actions of great heroes and villains. Entire king -  doms, continents, or planets may be threatened by evil  forces, and saved by the heroes who vanquish them.  f amiliar   h istorical   e lements  Most fantasy settings resemble the real world at a  roughly identifiable point in history. Perhaps the most  common influence, and what comes to mind first for  many people when they think of fantasy, is western  Europe in the medieval era. You can see this influence  in weapons and armor, architecture, religious practices,  social hierarchy and titles, and other facets of many  fantasy settings. Of course, there are plentiful works of  fantasy that resemble other regions or periods of his -  tory just as strongly. Many of the more developed fan -  tasy worlds also include many nations and regions that  strongly resemble actual historical cultures.  This familiarity can actually be pretty helpful in a  campaign. Although unique and intricately defined Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 140  fictional cultures can be fascinating, in the interest of  helping players to jump in and keep the game moving,  it’s perfectly okay to admit that, yes, the inhabitants of  the Northern Isles of Hjorn are basically Vikings. You  can always get into the details that set them apart later.  Of course, we’ve already covered many of the unique  elements that make a fantasy setting in other tropes. The  addition of magic, monsters, and absolute and tangible  forces of good and evil turn a seemingly historical set -  ting into a fantasy setting. Fantasy settings’ resemblance  to the real world varies; some are little more than medi -  eval Europe with the map relabeled and the creatures  and magic from folklore assumed to be true. At the  opposite end of the spectrum, a fantasy world might  have technology from disparate periods of Earth’s his -  tory, magically powered spaceships, and anthropomor -  phic animals instead of humans and elves.  k eeps   an D   D un G eons  Exploring and battling through castles, subterranean  ruins, and crypts is a hallmark of fantasy, particularly  when it comes to RPGs. Heroes may descend into  ancient and forgotten passages, or defend the battle -  ments of a castle against the forces of evil. Keeps, ruins,  dungeons, and the like are often an important factor in  quests—a MacGuffin might be located deep in an ancient  catacomb—and, of course, are often home to all sorts of  nasty monsters, vicious traps, and ancient treasures.  Dungeons provide an excellent location for adven -  tures far from civilization (whether physically or the -  matically) and even the relatively understood dangers  of nature. Dungeons are confining, even claustropho -  bic—characters encountering deadly monsters in the  wilds may have many avenues of escape, a luxury not  often found in dungeons. This provides for a harrowing  adventure with unknown dangers behind every door  and limited avenues for retreat or rest. In this way, dun -  geons are ideal for challenging characters and forcing  them to rely on their own abilities and ingenuity.  D ifferent   s tyles   of   f antasy  While the previous tropes find their way into nearly all  fantasy settings, the extent to which they do so varies.  One way to make a fantasy setting feel different and  unique is to upend one of the familiar tropes in some  way. For instance, perhaps in your setting, magic of all  kinds is outlawed. Or, at the other extreme, perhaps  “monsters” of all intelligent sorts commingle in cities,  with individual creatures just as free to choose good or  evil as any human—sure, some mummies are evil, but  this one just wants to run their tavern in peace!  Aside from such twists, there are already distinct  styles of fantasy largely defined by their own tropes.  Narrowing in on a particular style can help you decide  how to craft your own setting, and just makes it easier  to communicate the setting to players. Some of the  best-known and most recognizable styles of fantasy  include high fantasy, sword and sorcery, low fantasy,  and contemporary fantasy. Even within a particular  style or genre of fantasy, there is plenty of room for  different tones. Sword and sorcery, for instance, is well  known for oscillating between adventure and horror.  In high, or epic, fantasy, magic is evident in the world,  if not exactly common, and mighty heroes battle power -  ful villains and fearsome monsters. High fantasy features  all the tropes we’ve already described. Our Runebound  setting, for example, very much represents high fantasy.  The bulk of the information in this chapter addresses  the high fantasy subgenre, but we’ll give you a quick over -  view of the other subgenres we mentioned. In each over -  view, we’ll discuss how you might tailor the information  in the rest of this chapter to the subgenre being discussed.  s W or D   an D   s orcery  Sword and sorcery is an enduring style originating in  the pulp fiction magazines of the early to mid-twentieth  century. Sword and sorcery stories heavily feature the  dungeons and castles trope and familiar historical ele -  ments, even while they lack many of the fantastical  elements that distinguish high fantasy. Sword and sor -  cery stories focus on human protagonists, and if other  humanoid species do exist, they are likely rare, mysteri -  ous, and strange or downright evil. Magic, too, is rare  in sword and sorcery worlds, and likely the province of  evil individuals. That’s not to say magic is rare in sword  and sorcery   stories , only that within the context of the  fictional world, it’s a remarkable presence.  Without their own access to magical power, sword and  sorcery heroes tend to rely on their swordsmanship and  wits to overcome challenges. We use “heroes” loosely,  here—while sword and sorcery stories might feature  clear depictions of evil, particularly in association with  decadent sorcerers and their ilk, the protagonists are  often of questionable morals. Still, when contrasted with  villains who make human sacrifices to unspeakable gods  in exchange for power, they look pretty heroic.  There’s   a   strong   element   of   action-adventure   in  sword and sorcery, which helps differentiate it from  low fantasy, which tends to feature more mundane con -  flicts. From a rules perspective, it’s simple to convert  the material in this chapter to sword and sorcery. Don’t  give players access to all the new character options, and  think carefully before letting them take magic skills. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 141  l o W   f antasy  Low fantasy worlds are characterized by moral grey  areas and a grittier, more authentically medieval feel.  True, low fantasy may skew close to sword and sorcery  in this regard, but sword and sorcery settings typi -  cally feature more of the fantasy humanoids and magic  familiar to high fantasy. Whereas high fantasy stories  often feature epic quests and huge stakes, low fantasy  tends to focus on more personal conflicts.  Like sword and sorcery, low fantasy has no assumption  that protagonists are “heroes” in any moral sense, and it’s  likely the PCs are looking out for their own interests above  anything else. Low fantasy also frequently focuses on polit -  ical intrigue and conspiracy. Like other characters, nobility  and rulers are rarely good or evil, simply selfish and power  hungry. Characters in these settings tend to have more  “realistic” levels of ability. If you’re running a low fantasy  game, you may want to award XP at a slower rate.  c ontemporary   f antasy  Contemporary fantasy, sometimes known as urban  fantasy, is perhaps the most different of all. Rather than  a medieval-like world of limited technology or a purely  fictional setting, contemporary fantasy takes place on  Earth as we know it today—just with magic and mon -  sters. Running a contemporary fantasy game requires  the most deviation from the material presented in this  chapter, although really, that just means taking the  equipment and some other setting information from  the   modern day   setting, described on page   164   and  mixing it up with the magic rules from page   210 , along  with monsters like those on page   146   and possibly the  non-human fantasy species character options on page  142 . Whether these fantasy peoples and magic users  coexist openly with humans or dwell in a hidden realm  of magic invisible to everyday folk is up to you.  e xa M ple   s etting :   r unebound  F antasy Flight Games’ own Runebound setting is a  classic example of a high fantasy world. One rea -  son it is a good setting for a wide number of board and  miniatures games, from   Descent   to   Runebound   to  Runewars , is because it includes many of the recog -  nizable fantasy tropes, making it easily accessible to  players. At the same time, it has a rich and deep lore  that new games and expansions continually add to.  The Runebound setting is based on the world of  Mennara, with most of the action set on the continent  of Terrinoth. This region alone presents plenty of vari -  ety for adventures in terms of environments, cultures,  and creatures. The civilized regions of the continent—  and there is plenty of dangerous wilderness between—  are primarily the domains of the Daqan Baronies and  the Free Cities. The Aymhelin, the forested domain of  the Latari Elves to the south, is a vast woodland, and  the hidden city of Lithelin is a shining pinnacle of civi -  lization hidden in the trees. Nevertheless, the forest is  certainly no safe place for outsiders.  Threats of all kinds lurk in the darker places of Ter -  rinoth, from the desolate and haunted Mistlands to the  forgotten ruins scattered across the continent, some  dating from before the First Darkness. To the east are  the desolate and deadly plains of the Ru, but the evil of  the Uthuk Y’llan has not been witnessed in centuries,  and is surely nothing to worry about… Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 142  Yes, a great evil threatens Terrinoth, but the world of  Runebound is not an overly dark setting. Beauty and  wonder abound, and the alliances of humans, Elves,  and Dwarves have vanquished evil in the past. Perhaps  the defining event of Terrinoth’s history was the cre -  ation of the Orb of the Sky following the First Dark -  ness, that time when the three races united to repel and  destroy the demon-tainted Uthuk Y’llan. This victory  was only possible thanks to the unifying efforts of Tim -  morran Lokander, the greatest wizard to ever live. In  creating the Orb, an object formed of pure magic, Tim -  morran hoped his gifts could outlive him and continue  to serve the civilized peoples of Terrinoth.  Tragically, the legendary general and Timmorran’s  close friend Waiqar Sumarion attempted to seize the  Orb for his own power. Before his death at Waiqar’s  hands, Timmorran shattered the Orb and ensured the  thousands of resulting shards would be hidden across  the land. Waiqar swore that he would gather the shards  for himself, and he was granted undeath by dark forces  in order to pursue his dark aims for eternity.  The   shards—the   Stars   of   Timmorran—contain  incredible power, but only a mighty wizard could hope  to harness it. When the dragonlords invaded Terrinoth  during the Third Darkness, they gathered as many of the  Stars of Timmorran as they could, and inscribed potent  runes on the stones. The resulting runebound shards,  which the dragons gifted to their mortal servants, lack  the raw potential of the Stars, but they exhibit narrow  magic effects that nearly anyone can employ.  Although the dragons are gone, the runebound  shards remain scattered across Terrinoth. From his seat  of power in the Mistlands, Waiqar the Undying com -  mands his legions of undead in an endless effort to  gather the stones and command the power Timmorran  denied him over a millennium ago. Still, Waiqar is but  one threat, the runebound shards only one source of  power, and this story only one of many.  n ew   s tarting   C hara C ter   o ptions  A staple of fantasy is the presence of not-quite-human  species who coexist in the world, with varying  degrees of cooperation and good will.

This list isn’t complete, but it  should serve as inspiration if you make your own gear.  To help you design your own equipment, in the  description of each item, we explain a bit about why it  has the profile it does, including most of its item quali -  ties. Of course, when it comes to magical items, the  options really are limitless. If you’re designing your own  magic item, you should consult the item creation rules  on page   197 . You can make it do more damage, offer  more protection, and generally be better than equiva -  lent items. However, we recommend you increase the  price and rarity to compensate, and make it unique in  your world. You should also give it a name!  W eapons  The weapons we provide here aren’t a full and exhaus -  tive list of weapons for fantasy settings, but they do  cover most of the broad strokes. As you might expect,  the majority of the weapons are melee weapons.  C oinage  Treasure, and the acquisition thereof, are important  parts of many fantasy stories and games. Depend -  ing on your game, the physical transportation of  gold pieces or other coins might be something you  prefer to ignore in order to get on with the action,  but if you want the transportation of treasure to  be a part of gameplay, we suggest following the  standard encumbrance rules for incidental items  described on page   84 . You can also decide that a  single gold coin has a monetary value of 10 in our  generic currency system, and silver coins or their  equivalent have a monetary value of 1. This means  you can carry more money with less coins.  Clearly, these are solid, weighty coins. The heft  is certainly satisfying after slaying or outwitting  monsters to get the loot, but moving large quanti -  ties can be an issue. That’s why canny adventurers  look for gems, jewelry, art objects, and other trea -  sure items worth more than their weight in gold. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 144  a xe   ,   m ace   ,   or   s W or D  Although all are equally capable of inflicting fatal  blows, we’ve given these common weapons somewhat  different profiles to reflect particular strengths of each.  Axes are vicious weapons that can leave painful, inca -  pacitating wounds. Therefore, we gave them the Vicious  1 quality so that any Critical Injuries your character  inflicts will be worse than expected. Maces are simple  weapons, so they didn’t get any item qualities. Instead,  they are cheaper than other weapons. Designed to let the  wielder block and parry blows, swords can be defensive,  as well as offensive. To reflect this, swords get Defensive  1. Their sharp blades also make it easier to inflict Critical  Injuries, giving them a better Critical rating.  G   reats W or D   or   G   reataxe  Almost any hand weapon can be found as a great  weapon, although swords and axes are the most com -  mon. As you see from their stat lines, great weapons are  devastating, but require impressive physical strength to  swing (the greataxe) or coordination to keep their blade  in the right place (the greatsword). The greataxe and  greatsword also have some of the characteristics of their  smaller cousins (Defensive and Vicious, respectively).  h alber D  A halberd is a basic infantry weapon, basically an axe  blade mounted on a long pole. It requires two hands  to wield and is pretty heavy, but it’s cheap, it keeps an  opponent at arm’s length, and the cutting head can  shear through armor.  l i G ht   s pear  Although a simple weapon, a spear is easy to wield and  allows the user to keep some distance from an oppo -  nent. Hence, spears don’t have very high damage, but  the Accurate 1 quality represents their ease of use. In  addition, the Defensive 1 quality represents their use -  fulness at keeping someone at arms’ reach.  s hiel D  Whether crafted from wood, steel, or hide, shields are  common among warriors of all cultures and skill levels for  a simple reason: they keep you alive. The utility of a shield  for blocking and parrying blows cannot be overstated, and  thus shields are a staple of most ancient cultures.  We represented these elements of a shield by giving  it the Defensive 1 and Deflection 1 qualities. It also has  the Knockdown quality, since nothing beats a shield  for bowling someone off their feet.

Mail armor is somewhat noisy, so your character  adds   󲊸   to Stealth checks they make while wearing it.  h eavy   r obes  Swirling robes in the midst of combat can entangle an  attacker’s weapon and make it hard for an attacker to  pinpoint your vital areas.

That’s why we’ve given it a  low soak value, but no defense.  p late   a rmor  Plate armor absorbs a considerable amount of damage,  and the angled plates can turn aside blows entirely.  Hence, the armor both has a high soak value and pro -  vides some defense.  Plate armor is heavy and very noisy.

You may have noticed that details aren’t pro -  vided here for arrows or crossbow bolts. For  most fantasy campaigns, we recommend using  the standard rules for ammunition found on  page   89 . Your character is assumed to have  adequate ammunition for the adventure and  that they retrieve and reuse arrows and quarrels  when possible. A   󲊲   spent for an Out of Ammo  result could mean your character simply lost  count of their arrows, wasn’t able to recover as  many as usual, or even spilled their quiver.  However, suddenly running out of ammunition  can be anticlimactic and may not even make  sense—it’s pretty easy to see how many arrows  you have left in a quiver, after all. As an optional  rule, when a PC receives an Out of Ammo result,  you may allow the player to spend   󲊴   to have  only a single arrow or bolt left after the current  attack, and therefore have one more opportunity  to shoot. Better make it count!  Of course, you can keep track of individual arrows,  bolts, or other applicable pieces of ammunition  if you prefer.

When worn, a fine cloak’s encumbrance is 0.  h erbs   of   h ealin G  Herbs or poultices with ill-defined but powerful heal -  ing effects are a staple of many settings. These are often  slightly magical in nature.  When making a Medicine check, your character  may use herbs of healing to add automatic   󲊳   󲊴   to the  results. Herbs of healing are consumed when used.  t hieves   ’   t ools  This is a collection of lockpicks, files, wires, and oil con -  tained in a small leather pouch, used for quietly open -  ing locks. Needless to say, adventurers find these useful.  Thieves’ tools allow your character to attempt to  open any mechanical locks or latches, even compli -  cated ones. In addition, when making a Skulduggery  check to open a lock or latch, your character adds auto -  matic   󲊴   to the results.  t orch  Torches   are   wooden   sticks   with   oil-soaked   cloths  wrapped around one end. When lit, they burn for a  long time and help illuminate your surroundings.  A lit torch provides light and removes   󲊸   added to  checks due to darkness.

This is only  a starting point, of course, and you are sure to want  to invent additional creatures for your game. Human  adversaries from other settings can easily be included by  simply changing their equipment and ignoring any skills  or talents that don’t apply.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 148  CHAPTER 2:   STEAMPUNK  A lthough the term steampunk originated in the  1980s, the foundations of the genre go back much  further. As is often the case when it comes to defining  and categorizing fiction and its genres, opinions differ.  But a strong argument can be made that the origins of  steampunk lie in what are more commonly considered  the earliest science fiction stories, period. The fantastic  science and contraptions shown in the works of Jules  Verne, H. G. Wells, and Mary Shelley are based in the  technology of the 1800s but go far beyond what was  actually possible at the time. This advance beyond his -  torical realism is the core of steampunk.  t ropes  S teampunk means different things to different peo -  ple. At its most basic, steampunk is putting a gear  on a stovepipe hat. And in many ways, that’s a good  representation of the genre. In  steampunk,   familiar,   old-  time items, characters, and  concepts get an anachro -  nistic, industrial technol -  ogy twist. Steampunk can  encompass an aesthetic,  a technology, a quasi-  historical culture, and  more.   Steampunk  settings range from nineteeth-century England with  elements of fictitious technology to alternate presents  and futures dominated by advanced retrofuturistic  technology alongside delightfully antiquated customs.  Steampunk is a broad genre, with plenty of room for  variation and adaptation. Some steampunk settings  feature elements of other genres, commonly fantasy or  sci-fi. It’s easy to customize your steampunk campaign  by taking elements from the other settings presented in  this book and adding your own rules where you like.  For instance, if your steampunk world features clock -  work technology alongside magic and mythical mon -  sters, use the appropriate rules and character creation  options from the   fantasy   setting, on page   138 .  Setting aside such hybrid settings, here are some of the  tropes we feel define steampunk in any time or place.  i mprobable   t echnolo G y  Certainly, the most vital trope of any steampunk set -  ting is its technology. This, of course, primarily con -  sists of steam-powered contraptions of all kinds; take  away this focus on steam power, and you are simply  no longer talking about steampunk. However, steam -  punk also frequently features impossibly sophisticated  clockwork machines and outlandish experimentations  in electricity—usually of the mad science variety. You  might find clockwork robots, flying cars propelled by  steam engines, and Tesla coils run amok.  Steampunk technology can do nearly anything mod -  ern technology can, and may even go further—or at least  take it in a different direction. Technologies that failed or  ran their course in reality might flourish, from dirigibles  and ornithopters to difference engines and cogwork  computers. The setting may be one with technologies Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 149  that are simply ahead of their time compared to those of  the real-life 1800s, an alternate present in which inter -  nal combustion engines never replaced steam power, or  an entirely fictitious world where steam engines have  reigned supreme for centuries.  Steam-powered machines may be clanking, hissing  experiments liable to explode at the slightest provocation  or reliable technologies that have functioned for years,  and both extremes often exist alongside each other. It’s  an age of invention, regardless of what age (or universe)  it happens to be! Generally, steampunk technologies are  bigger, louder, and smokier than their modern digital  equivalents, replete with gears, pipes, smokestacks, and  brass tubing, but this isn’t always the case. You might also  have tiny mechanical insects operated by the most delicate  clockwork mechanisms, or other such miniature marvels.  v ictorian   a esthetic   ( a n D   t hen   s ome )  Hand in hand with improbable technology, a Victorian,  or at least pseudo-Victorian, aesthetic marks out most  steampunk works. Steampunk stories often take place  in a fictionalized version of London or some other part  of the British Empire during the nineteenth century  (or perhaps a twentieth century dominated by steam  power), but even those set in a different world entirely  tend to feature a heavy, even embellished sense of Vic -  torian style. This includes not only matters of dress and  architecture, but decorum as well. Even should their  adventures take them far from the heart of civilization,  steampunk heroes are quite often high-society types with  the freedom and resources to pursue a life of adventure.  It’s worth noting that the social problems and exploi -  tation of the 1800s may or may not be visible in steam -  punk. Some lighter steampunk adventures gloss over  such issues, but darker tales might place a lot of empha -  sis on exploited workers and poverty, with heroes fight -  ing to be more than just cogs in a machine (and putting  the “punk” back in “steampunk”).  However, steampunk stories and games don’t have to  closely resemble Victorian England. They might be set  in the American Old West, with gunslingers, despera -  does, and railroad tycoons using (or working against)  fantastical steam-powered machines well beyond the  locomotives of history. However, even if your game  takes place somewhere else on the globe or in a differ -  ent world entirely, it’s a good idea to still include some  of the more recognizable fashions and mannerisms of  Victorian British culture, since idealized or exagger -  ated versions of these are a major component of steam -  punk in the eyes of many.  i n D ustry   an D   a utomation  Steampunk takes all the promise of the Industrial Revo -  lution and ensuing innovation and runs with it. In part,  this is simply the catalyst for improbable technology (as  we already discussed), but it’s much more than that. Par -  ticularly significant advances in technology lead (both in  reality and conceivably in most imaginary worlds) to all  sorts of drastic social changes, and the more advanced  the steampunk tech gets, the more potential there is for  upheaval. Class distinctions and the way technology  affects them could be a major element of a steampunk  w hat ’ s   M y   i nspiration ?  There are three primary operative forces behind  the technology in most steampunk settings: steam  power, clockwork, and electricity. As in reality,  these need not be overly distinct, and many devices  could use more than one motive force. Steam tur -  bines can generate electricity, an experimental bat -  tery might supply the initial jolt to a complex array  of clockwork mechanisms, and so on.  When it comes to steampunk technology, there is  little that’s off the table. You don’t need to know  exactly how a machine operates, or if it’s even  possible. It is, however, generally a good idea to  think about the primary motive force for a device  and the end result, even if you have no idea of the  interim steps. Your players should know that the  flying machine they are embarking upon is steam  powered, and that its insect-like wings keep it aloft,  but there’s no need to get into the details of how that  all works. If you consider steampunk a subgenre of  science fiction, it definitely veers toward the softer  side. (See page   170   for more on this distinction.)  It’s typically more important that a technology  “feel” right. This is a matter of taste and discretion,  but it generally means keeping things from get -  ting too close to the modern day real world. For  instance, an electrically powered computer doesn’t  seem very steampunk, while a steam-powered dif -  ference engine is right at home. Likewise, electric -  ity running to every home feels too modern and  mundane, even though much more advanced appli -  cations, such as directed energy weapons, are per -  fectly appropriate.

Workers displaced by automated factories and other  machines might take up adventuring, set out for the  frontier, or turn to piracy to support themselves and  their families. These same technological advances that  reduce the need for human staff might also allow enter -  prising businesspeople to threaten the power of the tra -  ditional aristocracy. And all this is only dealing with  realistic steam technology. Fleets of steam-powered  airships could radically alter the way wars are fought,  while coaches carried aloft by balloons might make  flying cars a reality before (or instead of) automobiles.  While steampunk is typically anchored in Victorian  society, playing with the “what-ifs” of sophisticated  steam technology can open up great possibilities for an  exciting and unique campaign.  t hrou G h   a   G lass ,   f o GG y  Steampunk has been described as retrofuturism, and  this holds true to an extent whether your steampunk  game is set in an alternate past, an alternate present, or  an alternate future. Heavily informed by popular con -  ceptions of Victorian England and by definition heav -  ily informed by the steam-powered technologies of the  nineteenth century, steampunk pushes that technology  forward, but along a much different path than taken in  reality. The result is a world like Earth in the 1800s, but  different, and possibly nearly unrecognizable except on  certain fundamental details.  In a way, this trope highlights all the previous ones  we’ve discussed. Steampunk fashion is like Victorian  England’s…but not; it’s a thing all its own, with sym -  bols   of   machinery   (cogs,   pipes,   who-knows-what)  embedded directly into clothing and accoutrements.  Steampunk technology is like that of the 1800s, except  it does things that are quite probably impossible for  such power sources and materials. Society likewise  resembles an outdated era, but with exaggerated ver -  sions of the things that interest us about that time, the  exclusion of the more troubling parts, and the addition  of whatever else just makes the setting feel right.  Steampunk can be the future viewed through the  eyes of the past. Or it can be the past seen through  a contemporary lens. You might put yourself in the  shoes of someone living in the nineteenth century and  imagine what the future might hold based on recent  advances (looking at Victorian writers’ and inventors’  ideas that never worked in reality can be a good place  to start), or you might take modern technology and  work back, adapting it for a steam basis. Either way,  steampunk is about keeping one eye on the past and  one on possibility.  e xa M ple   s etting :   s overeigns   of   s tea M  T he sun never sets on the Heliotrope Sovereignty,  the vast empire stretching from the heart of long-  civilized Margosa to the sands of Tortogos in the North  and the ice wastes of the South. After a century of explo -  ration, expansion, and conquest, the other nations on  the continent have been brought to heel through diplo -  matic maneuverings, complex marriage arrangements,  and the mighty airships of the Royal Navy. No suitable  rival exists to challenge the majesty of Queen Vertiline  and the House of Heliotropa.  Long the dynastic seat of the Heliotropans, the city  of Steelhearthe has grown into a sprawling metropo -  lis capable of administrating a continent-wide empire.  Towering brick-and-iron buildings run for miles along  the banks of the mighty Airis River, and sprawling fac -  tories stain the waters and fill the air with the brown  smoke of burning coal. Each factory is surrounded by a  belt of tenements full of the workers who keep the boilers  lit and assembly lines running. The air of Steelhearthe is  so fouled by industry that the Queen employs a small  army of laborers to constantly clean and polish the crys -  talline walls of the towering Azurite Palace.  Here, within the indigo walls of the palace and the  various manors and estates that ring the city, exist the  rarefied heights of continental culture. Everyone, even  foreign dignitaries and nobles, travels to Steelhearthe in  the fall, when the southern winds blow away the worst of  the smog. For months, they mingle, gossip, and scheme,  striving to improve their stations and the fortunes of  their families. Most young debutantes and beaux dream  of marrying into the vast Heliotropan Dynasty. Not  only does this offer wealth and prestige, but it also guar -  antees a job in the sprawling Imperial bureaucracy. (For  this reason, the dynasty often arranges marriages based  on ability, intellect, and drive.)  Outside the halls of power, the lower classes toil in  Steelhearthe’s factories or struggle for survival in its  dark alleys and soot-stained tenements. The best that Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 151  most of Steelhearthe population can hope for is a mea -  ger salary to pay for cheap bourbon and exorbitant  rents. Revolutionary fervor flourishes in this climate.  Even with the constant presence of the Royal Army and  Imperial Inspectors, dozens of radicals plot to over -  throw the Sovereignty from within.  A vast spiderweb of rail lines stretches out from  Steelhearthe and links all of Margosa. The fruits of the  Heliotrope Sovereignty’s industries flow along these  lines to every corner of the continent, ensuring the  Empire’s economic dominion. Many of the smaller  countries grumble quietly that the railroad—along with  the recently completed telegraph network—ensures  military domination as well. Few wars or uprisings last  long when the Queen’s countless regiments of fusiliers  and hussars are only days away by rail.  Those who chafe under Imperial hegemony look to  the Tyrenia Colonies as the last refuge for freedom  and independence. For centuries, the scalding waters  of the Boiling Sea blocked all attempts at exploring  the unknown West. However, during the great Age of  Expansions, the invention of the rigid airship allowed  Agatha Scarborough and her crew to breach the steam  clouds. On the far side of the Boiling Sea, they found a  boundless expanse of islands and archipelagoes—unin -  habited, pristine, and full of valuable natural resources.  Scarborough’s discovery set off a furious land rush.  Though the Sovereignty claims nearly all of the Tyrenia  Colonies in name, enforcing this edict proves difficult  in practice. Tyrenia has become a haven of entrepre -  neurs, inventors, criminals, and revolutionaries. Any -  one who loathes the stifling class restrictions of Steel -  hearthe and wants to build a new life for themself need  merely find an uninhabited island and set up shop.  Plenty of colonies have been founded on the ideals of  liberty, socialism, and equality for all, and their inhab -  itants stand ready to defend those ideals to the death.  Of course, not all of those founding motives are so  pure. Some of the sandy coves and green canopies of  the farthest islands hide refuges of depravity and dark  science. More than one former member of the Royal  Society has fled to the Colonies after being expelled  for unspeakable experiments. Alchemical elixirs able  to transform humans into ravening beasts have begun  making their way back across the Boiling Sea in recent  years, causing chaos and mayhem on the streets of  Margosa’s cities. Even darker rumors have sprung up  concerning long-lost family and friends shambling into  a colonial town in some ghastly parody of unlife. Impe -  rial Inspectors roam the Colonies searching for these  mad scientists, and also to quash the stories claiming  that a few aristocratic families have paid handsomely  to resurrect a dear child or loved one. Some even claim  that the Royal Society has established its own clandes -  tine laboratory where it works to design a new clock -  work soldier so it can fill the Queen’s armies with metal  automatons. More than one revolutionary group would  pay dearly to find out if this is true.  The new charter corporations complicate matters  further. Founded by royal decree, these organizations  nevertheless have few aristocratic ties. The mercantile  classes control the charter corporations, giving new  luster to names like Sirius, Ward, Beryl, and Danburite  in Steelhearthe’s halls of power. These merchant fami -  lies see great opportunities in exploiting the Colonies  for their own profit. Already, Ward-Danburite colliers  bring back tons of fuel to Steelhearthe’s furnaces, and  if you travel to the Colonies, you likely do it aboard a  West Sirius airship.  Even those Colonies run by the Queen’s agents or  proper members of aristocratic households cannot  be counted on for loyalty. Victor Caine—governor of  Deckland, the largest and most “civilized” colony—  may fly the Imperial flag over his estate. However, he  happily takes money to let the Beryl family run its  quartz mines how it pleases, and he dispatches Royal  Hussars of his Argent Guard to break strikes at the  galvanite refineries. On the other hand, Coveward  Colony and the wayward Heliotropan scion Macken -  zie Heliotrope-Augustus don’t even pretend loyalty to  the crown, and they have shot down at least one Navy  airship to prove it.  These issues, plus the airship pirates, lost and aban -  doned colonies, secret military expeditions from rival  nations, and the occasional armed rebellion, make the  Colonies a patchwork web of conflicting interests. All  too often, these conflicts boil over into raids, plots, and  outright war. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 152  n ew   s tarting   C hara C ter   o ptions  C haracters in most steampunk settings are simple  humans, as detailed on page   36 . However, we  could imagine that a setting like Sovereigns of Steam has  a few non-human characters as well.  m on G rel  The so-called   mongrels are products of science run  amok. In Sovereigns of Steam these poor creations were  once human, but they had the misfortune of becom -  ing the experimental fodder of some mad reject from  the Royal Society. This depraved scientist used them to  test a certain alchemical elixir that unlocks their inner  bestial nature, turning them into a monstrous hybrid of  human and animal. After a time, the elixir can wear off,  returning these poor individuals to their human form.  However, the dark secret is that once the elixir enters  the blood, it works irrevocable changes on the imbib -  er’s biology. Thus, the change can return at any time.  In our setting, unscrupulous smugglers have been  returning this elixir to major cities for various reasons.  So, while your character could have been the unfortu -  nate results of a forbidden experiment, they also could  have been exposed to the elixir in their daily life. Of  course, once they drank it, their life changed forever!  Needless to say, so-called mongrels are shunned in  all levels of society, and they are actively hunted by var -  ious agencies of the Empire. Many flee to the Colonies  to escape persecution and arrest.  s pecies   a bilities  •  2   2   2   2   2   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Wound Threshold:   10+Brawn  •   Strain Threshold:   8+Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   100 XP  •   Special Abilities:   Mongrels begin with one rank  in Discipline.

They heal  all strain; increase their Brawn and Agility by one,  to a maximum of 5; and reduce their Intellect and  Willpower by one to a minimum of 1. They deal +1  damage when making unarmed attacks, and their  unarmed attacks have a Crit rating of 3. In addi -  tion, their jaws elongate into muzzles, their hair  thickens and they grow more all over their bod -  ies, and their eyes become those of a hunting cat  or wolf. Your GM should ensure that NPCs react  appropriately to this (at the very least, upgrading  the difficulty of all social skill checks twice). Your  character reverts to human form after eight hours,  or if they are incapacitated (by exceeding either  their wound threshold or their strain threshold).  •   The Human Spirit:   Once per session, your charac -  ter may make a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Discipline check  as an out-of-turn incidental.

Like mongrels, this is a very popular  type of character for steampunk settings.  A revenant may be created at the behest of a wealthy  grieving family willing to pay anything to bring back a  loved one. Alternatively, revenants may be created by  mad galvanists seeking to unlock the secrets of eter -  nal life. In either case, revenants have no memory of  their former lives, even should they retain their origi -  nal brain. Most who would pay to resurrect a loved one  have no idea of this sad fact until the deed is done. Still,  there are rumors of the occasional revenant eventually  recovering piecemeal memories of their former life.  Revenants are universally feared and reviled in regu -  lar society. A   revenant who cannot pass as a normal  human is likely to earn a bullet from the Imperial  Inspectors, so most stay in the underworld or, like  mongrels, flee to the Colonies to start a new life.  s pecies   a bilities  •  3   2   2   2   2   1  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Wound Threshold:   11+Brawn  •   Strain Threshold:   9+Willpower Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

And   that   means   fantastical   steam-  powered contraptions, mad science, and lots of cogs and  pipes. In this section,  we present a small sampling of the items you might  encounter in Sovereigns of Steam or in nearly any ste -  ampunk setting. This should get you started, but when  it comes to steampunk technology, there are few limits.  W eapons  In addition to the wilder weapons we present here,  most modern and fantasy weapons also fit into the  steampunk   setting. You may just need to make some  slight modifications in their description.  s prin G - f ist  A spring-fist is essentially a clockwork pair of brass  knuckles. At one end is a glove reinforced with metal  banding. The rest of the spring-fist is a series of coil-  springs connected to a sturdy framework that runs the  length of your character’s arm. When activated, it lets  your character strike with bone-breaking force. How -  ever, the springs require time to retighten after each  use, hence the Slow-Firing item quality.  The Slow-Firing quality does not stop your charac -  ter from making unarmed attacks in the intervening  rounds, but they do not benefit from the spring-fist’s  profile while doing so.  r otors W or D  This heavy “sword” features a rotating, bladed chain  that runs most of the length of the weapon. It is little  more than a steam-powered chainsaw held like a  two-handed sword. Although a rotorsword is  extremely deadly, the impracticality of hav -  ing to fuel it before battle has prevented  it from becoming a mainstay of fighting  forces. Additionally, bringing it to a gunfight  is still risky. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 154  We’ve given this grisly weapon the Vicious, Sunder,  and Pierce qualities to represent the horrible damage  its heavy rotating blade inflicts. To represent the weight  and impracticality of the weapon, we’ve added Inaccu -  rate and Cumbersome.  Rotorswords require two hands to wield (and use the  Melee (Heavy) skill if in settings that include that skill).  s W or D   c ane  A sword cane fits this setting quite well: a deadly  weapon concealed in aristocratic accessories. The blade  remains hidden in the cane, while the hilt is disguised  as the cane’s top. The sword cane has the Defensive  quality (as do most swords), and it has a special rule to  reflect how easy it is to hide.  Those searching a character add   󲊸   to any Perception  checks they make to find the sword inside the cane.  a uto   - r otary   G   un  This is a multi-barrel machine gun, like a real-world  Gatling or Maxim gun. However, rather than achiev -  ing its high rate of fire through hand cranking or recoil  operation, the steampunk auto-rotary gun is driven by  a steam engine. This results in a rather large and heavy  weapon that consumes a voracious amount of ammuni -  tion and coal (which take some time to arrange before  firing, represented by the Prepare quality). For obvious  reasons, this weapon has the Auto-fire and Cumber -  some qualities.  c lock W ork   G   rena D e  Our steampunk take on the common hand grenade is  a bulky canister containing a simple boiler heated by  combining two chemicals. When the user vigorously  cranks the device, the chemicals combine, generating  ferocious heat. This builds a massive amount of steam  pressure, giving the user has a few moments to throw  the grenade before the canister fragments. The explo -  sive pressure flings the metal shards in all directions at  high velocity, and splatter from the chemicals may burn  the targets as well (represented by the Burn quality).  Because the whole device is horribly unstable, if the  user generates   󲊲   on the check, the device blows up in  their hand, and they suffer an automatic hit dealing the  weapon’s base damage.  D   eath   r ay  Death rays are guns that fire a beam of energy with (as  you might have guessed) deadly results. Each death ray  is unique, the product of a deranged inventor or brain-  fried galvanist. The exact nature of the energy beam  and its creation vary depending on the inventor. More  than one inventor has claimed to have created their  death ray for peaceful purposes, and that the existence  of such a weapon will mean an end to war. Of course,  it’s actually only resulted in a death-ray arms race.  Our death ray fires a beam of electricity, radiated ions,  charged aether, or what-have-you in an erratic path, like  that of a lightning bolt.

Having a Critical rat -  ing of 1 means that this thing could be very dangerous  when used against player characters, so if you’re a GM,  think long and hard before you give this to an NPC!  h an D   c annon  A hand cannon is quite literally a breech-loading, large-  bore pistol that operates much like its larger kin. The  weapon is typically used for big-game hunting, and its  effects on a human target are predictably devastating.  The term is also sometimes applied to oversized revolv -  ers with similar stopping power. While hand cannons  of all makes generally take the form of a large pistol,  the recoil is such that all but the largest and strongest  individuals are advised to place both hands firmly on  the grip before pulling the trigger.  Someone firing a hand cannon probably has to brace  themself to deal with the significant recoil, which we’ve  represented with the Prepare quality. It has to reload, so  characters only get one shot (but that’s usually enough).  r epeatin G   r ifle  This profile covers any rifle that holds multiple cartridges.  It could be bolt or lever action, and fed by an internal  or external magazine, but these subtle differences don’t  affect the profile. It can’t fire quickly enough to warrant  the Auto-fire quality. However, you might describe an  attack that deals significant damage or a Critical Injury  as multiple bullets striking the target.  r otor   p istol  Something like the Gatling gun of the nineteenth  century, a rotor pistol consists of a number of barrels  that rotate rapidly in order to achieve a high rate of  fire. Unlike a Gatling gun, though, a rotor pistol isn’t  hand cranked; it is fired with a pull of the trigger. This  is achieved by means of a quartz-galvanite battery that  unleashes a single strong pulse of electricity that sends  the gun’s mechanisms into motion. After firing, you  have to not only completely reload the internal maga -  zine of the pistol, but also replace the battery.  The Limited Ammo quality doesn’t mean a rotor pis -  tol only holds one bullet, of course, but that a single  burst of fire consumes all its ammunition.  a rmor  Armor in a steampunk setting can be a strange mix of  the archaic and the weirdly advanced. You already have  the profile for heavy clothing (see   Heavy Jacket , page  93 ), and most steampunk settings can use the con -  cealing robes, leather armor, and chainmail from the  fantasy   setting (page   138 ). Here, we decided to focus  on some of the more exotic types of steampunk armor.  a D miral   a rthur   ’   s   a stoun D in G   a mplimotive   a rmor  This is a large, heavy suit of armor. The thick metal plat -  ing completely covers the wearer, although the helmet  may be easily removable or have a hinged faceplate. This  armor provides the best protection possible short of an  actual tank, but it is far too heavy for anyone to support.  That’s where Admiral Arthur Schilling’s patented steam-  powered amplimotive architecture comes in. By way of  a complex system of gears and hydraulics, the armor  responds to and enhances each movement by the wearer.  A character wearing this armor increases both their  silhouette and Brawn by one. (This does increase your  character’s soak accordingly.)  c o G suit  A cogsuit is a suit of makeshift armor assembled from  scavenged armor plates and machine parts (which  sometimes   include   cogs).   Such   armor   is   common  among pirates and other riffraff. However, these days the  name is also often used for specially made armor worn  by adventurers and agents of the Imperial Crown. Units  in the military use a variant of the cogsuit that provides  equivalent protection but looks much more professional.  i nsulate D   G   arb  This covers any sort of outfit designed to protect the  wearer from hostile environments. It may incorporate  cotton, rubber, asbestos, lead, or pretty much anything  that does, or might, protect against a particular hazard.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 156  In addition to its soak, insulated garb provides   󲊸   󲊸  to any Resilience checks made to resist environmental  extremes appropriate to the garb. If you need insulated  garb, an air mask (below) is probably also a good call.  G ear  Gear in a steampunk setting often is some bizarre ver -  sion of items we use every day. So, feel free to give your  characters a pair of binoculars, for example, but perhaps  describe them as goggles with dozens of lenses that fit  over their head and give them a bug-eyed appearance.  a ir   m ask  An air mask, sometimes called a breath mask or gas  mask, filters the air for its wearer. Sophisticated and  expensive models might instead include an air supply,  likely in the form of a backpack or hip canister.  An air mask allows a user to avoid being poisoned  by airborne toxins and to operate in corrosive atmo -  spheres without penalty. The more expensive version  with a built-in air supply allows the user to operate  underwater for one hour without penalty.  a eropack   or   a erosuit  This is any sort of personal flight device. Such items vary  greatly in operation and appearance, and most are unique  inventions. An aeropack might feature a steam rocket, a  propeller, or flapping wings of clockwork and canvas.  A character wearing an aeropack can fly (see page  100 ).   However,   flying   doesn’t   come   naturally   to  humans, and your GM might call for a Piloting check  in dangerous or unusual circumstances. In addition,  none of these devices are incredibly reliable, so a   󲊲  result means it runs out of power at the end of your  character’s turn and remains unpowered for the rest  of the session. (It also means that if your character  doesn’t make it to solid ground by that point, they’re  in for a fall!)  D   r   . W   ilson   ’   s   i ncomparable   m iracle   t onic  This curious elixir is, despite its name, only one of  countless such cure-alls available for purchase (also,  it was not developed by a real doctor). As with most  such products, both the ingredients and the effect of  the tonic are vague, but it indeed fulfills its promise to  soothe pain and enhance the user’s vigor and alertness.  A character who uses a maneuver to drink the tonic  increases their wound threshold and strain threshold  by five until the end of the current encounter, but must  succeed at an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Resilience check   as an  incidental or suffer 5 strain—an unfortunate side effect  of the quicksilver included in the tincture. If your char -  acter is already benefiting from the use of the tonic,  additional uses have no further effect. Furthermore,  once the effects wear off, if your character’s wounds or  strain now exceed their threshold, they’re immediately  incapacitated and suffer all related effects.  h oo D e D   l antern  A simple but ingenious modification of the common  lantern, the hooded lantern uses a metal hood and  glass lens to focus the lantern’s light, making the beam  travel farther and also making the light harder to spot  when it’s not directed squarely at an observer.  A lit hooded lantern provides light and removes  󲊸   added to checks due to darkness. (If it becomes  important to determine how far the light reaches,  a focused hooded lantern’s light can reach out to  medium range.) In addition, your character can use  a hooded lantern and not automatically be spotted at  night or in the dark (although they still need to add   󲊸  to any Stealth checks they make, because the light still  makes it easier to be noticed).  v an   r yn   ’   s   p otion   of   p aralyzation  This tonic does have the distinction of being created  by an actual doctor, who was attempting to invent an  anesthetic. However, various unscrupulous individuals  have repurposed it as a incapacitating poison.  A character may covertly drug someone’s food with  this poison (requiring an   opposed Skulduggery vs. Vig -  ilance check ) or apply it to a weapon such as a knife as  a maneuver. If the target ingests the poison or it enters  their bloodstream by other means, they must make a  Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Resilience check   as an out-of-turn inci -  dental   or become immobilized for the next three rounds.  The target also suffers 1 strain per   󲊱 , and your GM can  spend   󲊲   to make them test against the poison again at  the start of their next turn, as it remains in their system.

CHAPTER 3:   WEIRD WAR  W eird war settings are alternate-universe histori -  cal settings where one or another of humanity’s  global wars spun out of control and changed history as  we know it. Rooted in historical fiction and war stories,  weird war settings combine real-world history and alter -  nate history, liberally sprinkling them with horror and  sci-fi elements to create unique and exciting stories.  Weird war settings can take place in any historical era.  You can fight werewolves with the Roman legions, chase  ghost ships during the Napoleonic Wars, or protect vil -  lagers from packs of ghouls in the mountains of Afghan -  istan. You can even combine elements of science fiction,  building a setting where space marines fight demons in  abandoned starships.  t ropes  N ow that we’ve discussed, in general  terms, what a weird war setting is,  let’s talk about some weird war tropes. The  following section presents a few common  tropes found throughout weird war set -  tings.   As   with   everything  else in this book, the follow -  ing list should not be con -  sidered   definitive.   Instead,  you should use the tropes  presented here as a spring -  board to get you started on  your own custom setting.  a lternate   h istory  The most common and defin -  ing trope used in weird war  settings   is   alternate   history.  Alternate history takes real-world  historical   people   and   events   and  tweaks them, just a little bit, to make  them more fantastic than fact. Play -  ing fast and loose with history can be  exceedingly fun and rewarding and is  an interesting exercise in “What if?”  What if humans had developed space  travel in the late nineteenth century?  What if Mesoamerican cultures had  killed Cortez and driven the Span -  iards back across the sea, then  followed with their own inva -  sion force? What if an alien  spacecraft had been dug up  by Napoleon’s army in  1800 beneath the Great Sphinx? What if the Nazis actu -  ally had succeeded with all of their bizarre occult non -  sense? How would any of these events have reshaped his -  tory? Ask yourself questions like these when designing  your weird war setting and see where they take you.  Once you have your alternate history all laid out, you  may wish to take a hard look at it to see what you can  eliminate from actual history to make your setting more  fun to play in. It’s a sad fact that much of history is ugly  and complicated, a far cry from the sanitized stories  and heroic myths that most people know. As you cre -  ate your own setting, you may want to excise some of  those ugly and complicated elements in order to create  a more entertaining world to go adventuring in. At the  very least, you should check with your group to see what  level of historical realism they are comfortable with.  Take, for example, Fantasy Flight’s Tannhäuser setting  which takes the “cool” parts of late nineteenth and early  twentieth-century history and adds in a liberal dose of  the occult, myth, mad science, and conspiracy theories.  In Tannhäuser, a secret society of German nobles and  powerful occultists raised a long-dead German hero to  lead their country to greatness. This ancient and pow -  erfully evil leader united Germany, consolidated power,  and declared himself Kaiser of a new Reich. Then, of  course, this new Kaiser set out to conquer the world.  The Reich in Tannhäuser is very loosely based on the  Nazis’ Third Reich, but only loosely. Hitler was never  born, the Nazis never rose to power, and the real hor -  ror of concentration camps and war crimes has been  replaced by werewolves and demon soldiers. An undying,  all-powerful, 400-year-old Kaiser wields ultimate power  in Germany, backed by the toadying quislings of the  nobility. These changes remove much of the real-world Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 159  ugliness and tragedy of history, and it makes the bad guys  the Kaiser and the nobles. The average German is a pawn  in their malicious games, not another Nazi. This allows  players to enjoy a more storybook-like version of history,  where good and evil are clearly defined, and heroes wear  bomber jackets and punch out demons.  t he   o ccult  Another major component of weird war settings is the  occult. Paranormal forces and strange happenings mix  very well with the horrors of war, and there is no short -  age of real-life historical occult shenanigans out there  to pull from. Whether instigated by humans or “natu -  ral” phenomena, paranormal activity in your weird war  setting should be at the forefront.  The exact nature and amount of occult influence in  your game is, of course, entirely up to you. Perhaps the  occult exists only to the extent that secret societies are  using myths to control a populace. Or maybe you have  regiments of minotaurs charging Mk.I tanks with pro -  totype Panzerfausts. Are enemy scientists raising the  dead or creating supersoldiers by grafting the souls of  ancient heroes into living beings, or is it all a bunch of  hogwash meant to keep the populace in line?  m a D   s cience  Mad science is, along with the occult, another common  trope in weird war settings. The idea of advanced or  fantastic technologies developed years or generations  before their real-life counterparts is extremely compel -  ling. Mad science, as it pertains to weird war settings,  is largely focused on weapons of war, especially super -  weapons and doomsday devices, and these devices  often take the place of nuclear weapons.  As with the occult, the exact level of mad science can  vary from setting to setting. You can have a Napoleonic  War setting with flying machines and primitive internal  combustion, or a mid-twentieth-century setting with  death rays and alien technology. If you can imagine it  and you explain it well enough, your setting can handle  just about any strange technology.  Remember, though, no matter what your tech level is,  make it fantastic. Mad science is only similar to regular  science. Alchemy stands alongside chemistry as legitimate  science. All the promises of atomic power come true. New  types of elements allow for wondrous and unexpected  creations. Whatever the basis of your science is, it should  be relatively uncommon and absolutely amazing.  m onstrous   r e G iments  Paranormal, monstrous, or superhuman soldiers are  another popular theme in weird war settings. As a  world delves deeply into the occult and develops fan -  tastic technologies, inhuman creatures begin to appear  on the scene. Perhaps they were always there, lurking  on the fringes of modern society, waiting to make their  presence known, or maybe they were brought forth  from some nether dimension through black magics.  They can be creatures of myth or simply successful (or  unsuccessful) experiments on living or dead people.  Once there are fantastic creatures in a setting, it  doesn’t take long for them to appear in armies. Com -  mando groups composed of werewolves, infantry divi -  sions of the walking dead, or airborne regiments whose  members are all angels (or demons) are all possibilities.  Weird war military units that are composed in part or  wholly of inhuman creatures are usually special forces  units: small bands of highly trained creatures who act as  shock troops, commandos, infiltrators, saboteurs, and  the like. That’s not to say that all paranormal forces are  spec-ops (see the aforementioned zombie infantry), but  due to their power and rarity, fantastic creatures are usu -  ally seen as too important to be used as cannon fodder.  e xa M ple   s etting :   t annhäuser  A solid example of a weird war setting is Fantasy  Flight’s Tannhäuser. This setting is rooted in real -  ity but has departed radically from real-world history. It  depicts an Earth that is both familiar and strange, and is  embroiled in a decades-long war between nations and  between the natural order and the occult.  In 1877, a German lodge called the Triberium Carium  (Lodge of Rot) succeeded in resurrecting Heinrich Reffle  von Richtenberg, the thirty-third Grand Master of the  Teutonic Knights, who had died at   Königsberg   in 1477.  Within months, von Richtenberg had united the dispa -  rate provinces, duchies, and kingdoms of what had been  the Holy Roman Empire into a unified German Empire,  or Reich, and declared himself Kaiser. For the next thirty  years, the undead Kaiser consolidated power and pre -  pared his new Reich for war, pouring money, resources,  and manpower into occult (specifically raising and mak -  ing deals with demons) and technological research.  Meanwhile, in Russia, the October Revolution never  happened. The Romanovs remained in power, advised Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 160  by the undying Grigori Rasputin. Working hand in hand  with the Orthodox Church and guided by Rasputin, the  Russian government slowly evolved into a powerful the -  ocracy called the Directorate. Rasputin’s cunning machi -  nations set him up as the real power in the country. Like  the Kaiser, Rasputin seeks to harness occult power to  conquer the world. Specifically, he works to resurrect the  Slavic gods and enslave them to steal their power.  In far-off Japan, the end of the nineteenth century saw  Emperor Meiji attempt to overthrow the Sh Ō gun in an  effort to wipe out the samurai class and consolidate his  power. This failed spectacularly, however, and the rul -  ing class revolted against the Emperor. A civil war raged  for decades, until, using some combination of unknown  technology and occult sciences, Meiji finally brought the  war to an end, and saw his country become an arcane  and technological powerhouse in the process.  World tensions ratcheted up during this time, as  the Reich, the Russian Matriarchy, and the Japanese  Empire flexed their might and rattled their sabers at  one another. Western powers, led by the United States  and the British Empire, began tooling up for war even  while diplomats and spies worked tirelessly to suss out  the situation in Europe and Asia. Finally, in the wake  of the Tunguska Event in remote Siberia, the world  erupted in violence and was soon engulfed by a war the  likes of which had never been seen: the Great War.  The Reich captured nearly all of Europe, and the Kaiser  raised demonic forces to enhance his ruthlessly efficient  military machine. Through Project SVAROG, the Russian  Matriarchy, with the help of the reclusive genius Nikola  Tesla, succeeded in summoning and binding an ancient  Slavic god into the combat armor of a warrior-nun. This  woman, now known as Zor’ka, was put in charge of the  Russian military. The Japanese Shōgunate, under the  leadership of the elderly Emperor Meiji and the mysteri -  ous Shōgun Hatamoto Omokaze, seized much of main -  land China and portions of eastern Russia. Not to be left  behind in the field of occult sciences, Japan seems to have  summoned ancient   oni   and the demon general Itami.  Standing against this tide of war and chaos is the  Union, an alliance of western democracies led by the  United States and Great Britain. A technological and  industrial powerhouse, the Union is a spoiler, a bul -  wark against the rising tide of occult forces flowing  from the battlefields of Europe and Asia. Wreckage of  an alien spacecraft that crashed in the American South -  west in 1947 kick-started the Union’s advanced weapon  programs. Since then, the Union’s arms consortiums  and military labs have been scrambling to develop bet -  ter and more advanced weapon systems.  Forty-some years after hostilities began, the Great  War continues to grind on between the great powers.  There seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel, how -  ever, although not one borne of peace accords and cease-  fires. The major powers are exhausted and desperate,  short of soldiers and materiel and the will to continue  on. Treaties between the Union, Matriarchy, Reich, and  the Shōgunate have created powerful blocs and have  ushered in the endgame of the Great War. Each belliger -  ent faction grows increasingly reckless in its pursuit of  victory. Some great cataclysm seems to loom over the  world as increasingly powerful weapons are introduced  in an effort to end the conflict once and for all. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 161  s etting - s pe C ifi C   g ear  T he following is a selection of weapons and armor  with a decidedly weird war flavor. This list is not an  exhaustive one. Instead, it’s a guide to help you create  your own special weird war weapons and gear.  W eapons  Weird war’s weaponry tends to have a lot of similari -  ties with modern weaponry. To flesh out your setting,  you should use the weapons from the   modern day  section, found on page   164 .  D e W   p istol   an D   r ifle  Currently rare and experimental, directed energy weap -  ons (DEWs) project highly focused energy (light, elec -  tricity, or more esoteric energy), rather than solid pro -  jectiles, at a target. Directed energy weapons are equal in  power to lasers from other settings, but they tend to have  a shorter range and to dissipate on the surface of a target  (no Pierce quality). They more than make up for that by  regularly setting targets on fire (via the Burn quality).  f lash   G   un  Flash guns are a varied collection of weapons—subma -  chine guns, automatic rifles, machine guns—fitted with  propulsion units powered by Illirium batteries that give  them unparalleled rates of fire and stopping power. The  lingering effects of the energy propulsion system tend  to rattle enemy troops they don’t kill outright. This flash  gun is based off of a basic submachine gun, while flash  technology provides the Disorient and Pierce item quali -  ties. Other flash guns can be created by using the rifle or  pistol stats and adding Disorient and Pierce.  f lash   m achine   G   un  The flash machine gun (the A6a) uses the same Illirium  batteries as the flash gun to propel its rounds, but it shoots  larger bullets at a higher rate of fire. Bulky and finicky, these  new weapons are extremely good at pinning down enemy  formations or scything through occult horrors. They are  big and bulky enough that only the strongest individuals  can wield them without a tripod or other support.  m eteop   l auncher  Meteops are small, dome-shaped explosive devices that  are, essentially, high-powered anti-personnel weap -  ons. They are fired from bulky, single-shot launchers  and are typically used to break up enemy formations  or clear rooms and vehicles. The launchers themselves  are heavy and awkward, which gives them the Cumber -  some quality. The meteop munitions provide the raw  damage, low Crit rating, and high Blast quality.

This is because, more often than not,  the heroes of these settings are the people fight -  ing the monsters, not the monsters themselves!  However, if you want to play a more monstrous  hero, we recommend using the mongrel species  as a werewolf derivative, and the revenant spe -  cies as a resurrected soldier (see page   152 ).

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 162  e lectric   t runcheon  Electric truncheons are nasty, ostensibly non-lethal  weapons designed for crowd control. Think of them as  clubs that also shock their targets on contact. The Dis -  orient quality reflects the truncheon’s electrical charge.  The charge is not necessarily enough to be lethal, hence  the Stun Damage quality (but a powerful shock can still  kill someone, so the weapon has a Critical rating).  r azor   W   hip  Razor whips are made of flexible, braided alloy with  razor-sharp blades embedded within. They can shred  through armor and flesh (the Pierce quality) and can be  used to entangle targets (the Ensnare quality). Whips  also tend to have a special rule allowing wielders to  attack targets that are farther away.  A razor whip can be used to make melee attacks  against targets at short range. The difficulty for this  attack is   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) .  a rmor  Wars in the nineteenth and early twentieth saw very little  armor. However, in our alternate reality, science can pro -  vide novel protections against bullets and werewolf claws.  i llirium   b G-42   v est  One of the factors that has allowed the Union to match  its supernatural foes in the field is the rare and power -  ful element known as Illirium. Illirium batteries power  Union flash guns, and Illirium-reinforced armor vests  not only can absorb bullets (hence the soak value), but  can temporarily be energized to create a force field.  When wearing a BG-42 vest, once per encounter as  an incidental, your character may activate the force  field to gain melee and ranged defense 2 until the end  of their next turn.  t esla   c oil  The Matriarchy pioneered Tesla coils as personal force  fields. Made largely of glass and alloy and worn on a belt  or strap, they project a crackling electric field to deflect  enemy fire (represented by the item’s defense rating).

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 164  CHAPTER 4:   MODERN DAY  M odern day settings are a catchall that encompass a  number of subsettings including, but not limited  to, modern horror, spy thrillers, detective stories, and  military adventures. These settings are home to countless  action movies, modern warfare video games, spy novels,  and a host of police procedurals and hard-boiled detec -  tive stories. In modern settings, hard men and women  battle against crooked bureaucrats, vicious killers, terror  cells, and the Mob. It’s basically the stuff of modern day  escapism and wish fulfillment, and is a fun and interest -  ing departure from elves, zombies, and spaceships.  As with the other settings described in this book,  modern isn’t a particularly rigid genre. While most  modern day settings take place “now” or “next Tues -  day,” they don’t need to if you don’t want them to. If you  like, you can set your modern game during the Cold  War and play it as an espionage thriller. Or maybe your  game is based on exploitation films and takes place in  the 1970s with plenty of crooked cops and kung fu.  Think of modern settings as happening in the latter  part of the twentieth century or the first few decades  of the twenty-first century, and you’ll get the picture.  t ropes  W ith that in mind, we’ve put together a short list of  tropes that exemplify a modern day setting. It’s  not a definitive list, but it does give you a good place to  start and is mostly presented as a way to give you some  examples so you can kick-start your own setting.  m ovie   r ealism  While modern settings are heavily based in the mod -  ern real world, they are not intended to be entirely real.  “Verisimilitude” is the watchword of the modern set -  ting, and the best example of that is movie realism. In  the movies, shotguns blast people through heavy wood  doors, and spies leap from rooftop to rooftop or jump out  of airplanes without messing up their perfectly coiffed  hair. Heroes survive numerous gunshot wounds or falls  through plate-glass windows and villains concoct con -  voluted schemes that would make Machiavelli jealous.  When designing your modern setting, keep in mind  that movie realism trumps real-world rules and laws  every time. Never let physics get in the way of a good  brawl, AK-47s are perfectly accurate when fired from  the hip at full auto, and hacking into secure government  computer systems always involves a slick graphical user  interface. Follow the Rule of Cool (on the next page) and  keep the action moving, and your players will stay happy.  G roun D e D   t ech  The technology in modern settings is rarely, if ever, more  advanced than what we might see next month or next year  in the real world. Cars are still cars, guns are still guns, and  any significantly advanced technology—optical camou -  flage, jetpacks, smart guns—are either rare prototypes or  one-off special gear for use by government agents.  The tech level in a modern game should be believable  and should roughly match the era in which the game is  set. Don’t include cell phones in a Cold War setting, for  example. When designing equipment for your setting, Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 165  we recommend checking out real-world information  on emerging technologies (or historic technological  dead ends) and extrapolating from there. Remember  your verisimilitude, and you’ll never go wrong.  a G ents   of   the   s tate  In modern game settings, players are commonly mem -  bers of official government agencies. They are the police,  the army, espionage agents, or some other agent or func -  tionary with governmental authority and the clearance to  use it. Typically, they are special units or lone-wolf types,  a trick that lets a player group of, say, U.S. Marines, go  on an adventure unsupervised in the middle of Afghani -  stan. However, depending on your game and the themes  you’ve decided on, your players could be mercenaries,  burned spies, or disgraced police officers struggling to  get the bad guy while repairing their reputation.  Having your players take on the role of soldiers,  secret agents, police officers, or members of some other  government-sanctioned organization gives them both  a believable motivation for their actions and at least  some authority. In the real world, you can’t just take up  a shotgun and become a vigilante, at least not without  incurring some serious legal trouble. In a modern role-  playing game, though, your players could be members  of a secret federal law enforcement agency tasked with  taking down the worst criminals in the country by any  means necessary. This allows for spectacular adven -  tures without the threat of arrest, jail time, or worse.  s etting - s pe C ifi C   g ear  T his section presents a list of weapons and armor  commonly found in modern settings. While there  is a lot to choose from here, this list is by no means  meant to be exhaustive or definitive. Instead, the  weapons and armor presented here are meant to pro -  vide a base from which you can build up your own spe -  cific gear lists to fit the flavor of your game.  t he   r ule   of   C ool  The Rule of Cool states that “The limit of the will -  ing suspension of disbelief for a given property is  directly proportional to its degree of coolness.” In  other words, something ridiculous is easy to accept  in media if it’s sufficiently cool. Two spies chasing  one another along construction gantries hundreds  of feet in the air? Cool. Blasting a bad guy through  a sheetrock wall with a shotgun? Cool. Escaping in  a stylish European sports car that turns into a sub -  marine? Very cool. Basically, if it’s exciting, makes  even a little bit of sense, and doesn’t fly in the face  of the laws of physics and nature too much, it’s cool.  This can be taken too far, however. You have to  keep two important things in mind when including  things in a setting just because they’re cool. First,  people (even gamers) can only suspend their dis -  belief so far. Second, cool is subjective. The Rule of  Cool doesn’t give you a free pass to run roughshod  over game realism and suspension of disbelief. It’s  supposed to be a way of spicing up a setting and  incorporating exciting and explosive scenes with  a healthy serving of movie logic. Always keep in  mind the stated tone and themes of your game, and  remember that verisimilitude—the appearance of  truth or reality—is every bit as important to keep -  ing your players engaged as coolness is.  For example, if you’re playing a modern horror  or horror survival game, you expect to encounter  things like zombies and sorcerers and bloody sac -  rifices in jungle temples. If you’re playing a gritty,  reality-based,   modern   warfare   game   in   which  you’re trying to save the world from a globe-  spanning terror cabal, you expect to find rogue  generals and warlords and corrupt politicians, not  zombies. If suddenly your hard-bitten, high-speed/  low-drag modern warfare characters are jumped by  a pack of zombies without your having stated at the  beginning that “Hey, there will be some supernatu -  ral elements in this game,” your players are going to  object, no matter how cool you think zombies are.  M odern   d ay   e xa M ple   s etting ?  Unlike our other settings, the modern day setting  doesn’t come with an example, because you’re liv -  ing in one. Your everyday life is the modern setting,  as are most of the movies, books, and video games  you consume (all of which work for inspiration). Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 166  W eapons  Throughout this section, we’ve provided insights into  how each weapon was designed and why specific char -  acteristics and qualities were assigned to them. These  tips are included to help you create your own weapons.  b rass   k nuckles  Brass knuckles are very simple weapons: chunks of  brass designed to slip over your fingers and add power  to your punches. Brass knuckles really are simple  weapons, and this profile could also represent a roll  of quarters.  c ollapsible   b aton  Simple but effective, this is a telescoping baton with a  weighted tip. A powerful swing can break bones. If you  want to do a larger riot-control baton instead, increase  the damage by one or two, but increase the encum -  brance by the same amount.  s tun   G   un  The name “stun gun” is a bit of a misnomer; it’s a  hand-held device with protruding electrodes. Push  the electrodes into an opponent, and they get shocked.  That’s why the weapon has damage that can’t be modi -  fied by your character’s Brawn (you don’t hit people  with a stun gun; you just touch them with it), and any  similar weapon should follow a similar profile. Obvi -  ously, the Stun Damage quality is another must, and we  added the Stun quality to represent some people suffer -  ing worse effects than others from the electric shock.  We also gave it a Critical rating; after all, an electric  shock can occasionally do lasting damage!  a ssault   r ifle  While clattering, hard-hitting assault rifles are ostensi -  bly military weapons, they can and often do fall into the  hands of gangs, crime syndicates, and insurgents. The  assault rifle presented here is a basic AR- or AK-pattern  rifle like those carried throughout the world. The Auto-  fire quality is the primary thing that separates these  weapons from other types of rifles, although they can  be fired on semiautomatic as well (your character may  choose whether or not to use Auto-fire). Assault rifles  do roughly the same damage as other “long guns.”  Many militaries make carbine versions of their assault  rifles, such as the U.S. military’s Colt M4. They’re more  compact than full-sized rifles and a bit easier to wield.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 167  Carbines change their range to medium, but decrease  their encumbrance by one.  h untin G   r ifle  Hunting rifles are nearly as ubiquitous as pistols in  developed countries with a long history of hunting and  sporting. These rifles have long barrels and are often  fitted with long-range telescopic sights to increase their  performance and accuracy.  The hunting rifle presented here is a double-barreled  deer rifle in a standard hunting caliber like .30-06, .308,  or 7 mm. You may reduce the damage by one for smaller  varmint rifles, or increase it by one for big-game weap -  ons like elephant guns. Most hunting rifles should have  the Accurate quality, since they’re built for single-shot  accuracy. Finally, a hunting rifle can have an internal  magazine. These rifles lose the Limited Ammo 2 qual -  ity, but increase their price by 100.  l i G ht   an D   h eavy   p istol  The ubiquitous pistol is the go-to solution for law  enforcement, sport shooting, self-defense, and crimi -  nal activity throughout the world. For game purposes,  modern pistols are separated into two categories: light  and heavy.  The light pistol listing is for a basic, medium-caliber  pistol: a 9 mm or .38 caliber weapon, for example. If you  want, say, a .22 caliber pistol, you could reduce the dam -  age by one and increase the Critical rating by one. If it’s a  cheap, disposable “Saturday night special” kind of gun,  maybe give it a rank or two in the Inaccurate or Inferior  qualities instead. Heavy pistols are the big, bulky hand  cannons that show up in movies in the hands of cops on  the edge or great big heroes. Their damage and Critical  rating can also be adjusted up or down by one (but not  more) to reflect larger or smaller calibers.  m achine   G   un  Machine guns are large, heavy, often crew-served weap -  ons. Depending on the type, a machine gun can be any -  thing from a medium-weight, man-portable squad-sup -  port weapon to a heavy, turret-mounted .50 cal.  The machine gun presented here can be used for any  of the medium-caliber squad-support weapons like the  M60, M249, or MG4. They’re designed to be carried in  the field, but they still have a high encumbrance (check  out page   207   for rules for a bipod or tripod for this  weapon). Heavier machine guns can have their damage  increased by two, although you should increase their  encumbrance and Cumbersome rating by two as well.  p ortable   m issile   l auncher  The weapon presented here represents one of the count -  less shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles used through -  out the world, such as the Stinger missile. Their extreme  range and Guided quality reflect the fact that they are  long-ranged anti-vehicle weapons. They, of course, only  hold one missile at a time and need a few moments to  set up, so the Limited Ammo and Prepare qualities are  a must for these weapons (reloads for these launchers  should cost half of the weapon’s initial cost). If you want  to create an anti-armor weapon like a TOW, the Breach  should be increased to 5 and Prepare to 2.  s hot G un  When you really want to make an impression in a fire -  fight, a shotgun is a great way to go. Pulling a pistol  from a hidden pocket just doesn’t have the same dra -  matic effect as, say, drawing a lever-action 10 gauge out  of a box of roses in slow motion. The flat thump of the  report, the muzzle flash, the shocking recoil, even the  loud   clack-clack   noise of working a pump action make  these weapons an assault on everyone’s senses, and also  is what makes them so popular in action movies!  The stat line in   Table II.4–1   is for a basic pump or  semiautomatic hunting weapon with buckshot. Shotguns  possess the Blast quality due to the cloud of shot they  fire and the Knockdown quality due to the concussion Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 168  of their blast (and, honestly, the Rule of Cool). The basic  shotgun stat line also assumes a magazine-fed weapon.  If you wanted to have a simple break-action single- or  double-barreled shotgun, you would give the weapon  the Limited Ammo 1 or 2 quality. Sawed-off shotguns  have their encumbrance reduced by two, and they gain  the Inaccurate 1 quality.  If you really want to dress up a scene, a charac -  ter wielding a shotgun could add   󲊸   to any Coercion  checks, especially if they rack the slide and glare men -  acingly at the target.  s ubmachine   G   un  Submachine guns (SMGs) use pistol-caliber ammuni -  tion and a high rate of fire to provide a whole lot of  damage capacity in a small, easy-to-use package. They  are popular among criminals, police, and special forces  operators the world over.  The SMG presented in   Table II.4–1: Modern Weap -  ons   on page   166   is a typical 9 mm weapon that might  be used by a metropolitan police force or carried by a  drug lord’s bodyguard. It deals the same damage as a  light pistol, since they share calibers. It can fire full auto,  so it has the Auto-fire quality. Even when it doesn’t fire  on full auto, we imagine each “shot” is actually several  bullets, and so we gave it a lower Critical rating to rep -  resent the sheer amount of lead it puts in the air.  s niper   r ifle  While they vary by service and country, all sniper rifles  are designed to fire high-caliber, high-velocity rounds  over long distances.  The sniper rifle entry here is a basic dedicated sniper  rifle like the U.S. Army’s M24 rifle. The range is extreme  to represent its ability to reach farther than even regu -  lar hunting rifles. Sniper rifles possess the Accurate and  Pierce qualities to reflect their excellent balance and  specialized rounds. They do, however, have a smaller  magazine, hence the Limited Ammo quality.  a rmor  Many modern militaries provide body armor to their  members, as do police departments. Even private  individuals can buy it, although it tends to be expen -  sive. Also, keep in mind that these items work for the  weird war   and   science fiction   settings as well.  f lak   v est  In modern times, most militaries, police departments,  and people in a war zone use flak vests. These are made  from lightweight polymers and ballistic fabrics and  provide decent protection from small arms and shrap -  nel (as represented by the vest’s soak value).  r iot   a rmor  A staple of police departments the world over, riot  armor is designed to protect from stones, bottles, shrap -  nel, and small-arms fire. The suit includes a helmet  with eye protection and a large polycarbonate shield for  deflecting blows and pushing crowds. We represent this  with the higher defense and moderate soak, since the  armor deflects hits better than it stops bullets.  Your character must use one hand to carry the riot  shield. If they do not, the armor’s defense drops to 1.  G   hillie   s uit  Ghillie suits are simple camouflage suits that conceal  snipers and forward observers. A suit is little more than  a baggy shirt and pair of trousers covered in countless  strips of fabric, clumps of grass, and other detritus.  Since ghillie suits are designed to obscure rather than  protect, they have a single point of defense but no soak.  Characters trying to spot someone wearing a ghillie  suit upgrade the difficulty of their check once.  G ear  The following are just a few examples of modern gear. A  lot of this also works well in other settings (especially the  extra clips, which can fit in any setting).  e xtra   c lip  This is exactly what it sounds like: an extra clip of  ammunition for a ranged weapon.

CHAPTER 5:   SCIENCE FICTION  S cience fiction is, as the name implies, a genre that  merges scientific theory and accuracy with fictional  stories. People often use the term to describe so-called  “hard sci-fi” and “soft sci-fi” interchangeably. Hard sci-fi  focuses more on grounding the story with scientific real -  ism, while soft sci-fi worries less about scientific accu -  racy and generally has many more fantastical elements.  One thing you should keep in mind about hard and  soft science fiction is that these aren’t rigorous definitions.  Each is one end of a broad spectrum, with most works  of science fiction falling somewhere in between. Most of  the science fiction you read or watch will have elements of  realism alongside fantastical inventions, but will probably  trend toward one end of the spectrum or the other.  In   Chapter 5 , we focus on the more traditional defi -  nition of science fiction as fiction grounded (mostly) in  science, while   Chapter 6   looks at the other end of the  spectrum (which we call “space opera”).  t ropes  W ith all this in mind, we’ve assembled some tropes  that we think characterize hard science fiction.  This list is by no means exhaustive, but it should serve as a  solid starting point if you want to build your own setting.  l imite D   s pace   t ravel  Science fiction settings may not have any space travel  beyond our modern space-flight capabilities. If they do,  it’s often still limited in scope. In many hard science fic -  tion settings, humans have built space stations around  the Earth and colonies on the Moon and other nearby  worlds (Mars, for example). They may even have out -  posts across the solar system, and may have explored  most of it with crewed and automated vehicles.  However, space travel is still likely to be expensive,  dangerous, and slow. Getting from one planet to another  takes weeks or months, plenty of things can go wrong,  and only major businesses and governments are rich  enough to afford spacecraft. You should think of space  travel as more akin to crossing oceans during the Age of  Sail, rather than flying across them in a modern jet.  Finally, interstellar travel is likely nonexistent. Any  spacecraft sent to another star would take centuries (or  longer!) to reach its destination, and there’s no way to  sneak around the light barrier.  r eco G nizable   p olitical   an D   e conomic   s tructures  Hard science fiction tries to present a realistic (or at least  recognizable) world. When you create your setting, an  easy way to accomplish this is to use economic and politi -  cal structures that are very similar to those of today. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 171  For example, it’s unlikely that the nations of Earth are  going to unify into a single world government any time  soon. Instead, consider close alliances modeled after  the European Union (a more closely unified African  Union, perhaps?) The United Nations may still exist,  but its power may have grown or shrunk. Perhaps some  nations have changed drastically in your setting. The  USA may have morphed into the American Empire, or  maybe it has failed and fractured into patchwork alli -  ances of nation-states fighting among themselves.  Likewise, businesses and corporations may look very  similar but have greatly expanded power and authority  in your setting. This is a popular theme in modern hard  science fiction, and it touches on our concerns about  society being dominated (and even ruled) by faceless  multinational corporations.  t he   Goo D … an D   the   b a D  One easy way to keep your hard science fiction set -  ting feeling realistic is to incorporate a good side and  a bad side into your major technological and societal  changes. Upsides and downsides are something we  tend to associate with real life, while in fiction, things  tend to be good or bad, but not both.  So, when working on your hard science fiction set -  ting, try to add some realistic tradeoffs for some of the  biggest ways your setting differentiates from the real  world. For example, if your setting has a lot of space  travel, maybe mention some of the health risks asso -  ciated with prolonged zero-g. If society has started  using lots of robots for manual labor, remember all the  human workers who lost their jobs to an android. And  if a more powerful UN keeps Earth’s nations from start -  ing wars, consider the potential resentment of people  who see their liberties being taken away by a distant  central government.  t echnolo G y   i s   o ne   s tep   a hea D  One way to keep your sci-fi setting feeling relatable  and realistically plausible is to keep the technology lev -  els “one step ahead” of what we can do in the modern  world. For example, faster-than-light communications  are pretty unbelievable, but it’s easy for us to accept the  idea of a bigger, more complicated Internet with a vir -  tual reality component. Likewise, your spaceships and  buildings are probably going to be built out of some  composites or alloys made from existing materials, not  super-strong “star-steel” mined from distant worlds.  When deciding on the technology level of your  setting,   spend   some   time   reading   up   on   current  technological advances and what the experts think  might be the next likely breakthroughs. You don’t  need to get too detailed, but some broad information  is going to help your setting feel like it’s grounded in  reality. On that note, let’s talk about some specific tech -  nologies and why you might focus on them.  t he   n e W   f rontier  One of the core themes of science fiction is exploring  the effects of new technologies on humanity. Of course,  what is “new” can vary depending on when a work of  sci-fi is created, which is why we’ve seen the focus of  science fiction shift drastically over the past century.  So, some of the technologies we talk about have only  come into the public eye in the last few decades. Oth -  ers, of course, have been around since the beginnings  of science fiction.  c lones   ,   a rtificial   i ntelli G ence   ,   an D   r obots  While the idea of cloning humans is fairly recent,  robots have been a staple of science fiction since before  science fiction was a recognized literary genre. (In fact,  the idea of an artificial person has appeared in myths,  legends, and stories throughout history.) After all, if  science fiction is supposed to explore the effects of new  technologies on humanity, what better way to do that  than to have the new technology bring up questions of  what it means to be human?  Using clones, AI, and intelligent robots in your setting  gives you a chance to ask a lot of questions about the  definition of humanity and intelligence. Are these clones  less than human because they were grown in a lab? Does  a corporation own a sapient robot just because that cor -  poration built it? Can an artificial intelligence with no  physical body truly be “alive?” By forcing your players  to grapple with these questions, you also may get them  to ask some questions about their own humanity. And  at the very least, it’s fun to think about.  G   enetic   m anipulation  If clones and robots raise the big questions about what  it means to be human, genetic manipulation and modi -  fication is a technology that asks similar questions in a  subtler way. How much can we change our own genetic  code and still remain human? Is modifying an unborn  baby’s genes to protect against certain illnesses or birth  defects ethical? And what about modifying genes for  cosmetic reasons, such as physical appearance? What  if we could make ourselves stronger, smarter, or faster  from birth? Wouldn’t we want to give the next genera -  tion the best chance to survive and thrive? Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 172  This is something that may be very interesting for  you to explore in your setting, because the ethical  questions of genetic manipulation are ones our society  is wrestling with right now. Just remember, don’t treat  genetic manipulation as magic. In a hard science fic -  tion setting, it’s unlikely that splicing a human embryo  with tiger genes will lead to a baby were-cat.  c limate   s cience  The technologies we’ve talked about up until now have  let us look at how they affect humans directly. While it  is not a technology, climate science is a topical issue that  lets you look at how humans can affect the world around  them. How humanity handles this issue can also set  the tone for your setting—whether more optimistic or  more pessimistic. Even touching briefly on it, perhaps by  depicting the Statue of Liberty surrounded by seawalls,  can remind your players that they’re in the future.  n anotech  Nanotechnology is a popular topic of science fiction,  and something that certainly has a place in some hard  science fiction settings. However, when you add nano -  tech to your setting, be careful how you go about it!  Often, writers and filmmakers treat nanotech as some  sort of magic panacea, by which a dose of microrobots  can do anything from cure disease to construct din -  ner out of component molecules. This highly advanced  (and highly theoretical) technology is going to feel out  of place in a hard science fiction setting. If you use nan -  otech, limit it to very specific uses, and keep in mind  some potential side effects and risks.  b reak   the   r ules … o nce   or   t W ice  Hard science fiction is predicated on the idea that the  fiction is based on existing scientific principles as much  as possible. There’s no set minimum for how much  science you need to have in a science fiction setting,  but the more fantastical elements you introduce, the  more your setting becomes “science fantasy” or “space  opera.” (See page   179   for more information about the  space opera   setting.)  Some people who develop hard science fiction set -  tings keep their settings firmly grounded in existing  scientific principles. These settings only have technolo -  gies that already exist or are likely to be invented in the  next few decades based on existing scientific research.  However, this imposes some pretty sharp limitations  on what they can do in their own settings.  Therefore, an option many people take is to choose  one   or   two   technologies   that   break   from   those  limitations: a couple of technologies that may seem  reasonable, even if we as a species have no idea how  to figure them out quite yet. For example, in the  Android   setting, the creators added two technologies  that are currently outside our grasp. One is plentiful,  reliable fusion power (as of this writing, we know it can  be done, but we don’t know how to replicate it in a lab  and make a surplus of energy out of it). The other is  braintaping, the technology that allows corporations  to record a human mind and use the recording to cre -  ate a thinking android or cloned human. It’s something  that seems reasonable when you hear it described, but  nobody has any idea how to do it.  r ules   t hat   s houl D n   ’   t   b e   b roken  However, there are some technologies that are too far-  fetched to be believable. If you use these in your setting,  you will probably push it from a science fiction setting  to a space opera setting. There’s nothing wrong with  this, but again, you may want to check out page   179  in that case.  Here are some common technologies that cross the  line into the realm of the fantastical:  •   Faster-than-light   travel:   Given   everything   we  know now, faster-than-light travel is a lovely fantasy,  but not in any way realistic. If you want your setting  to feel scientifically accurate, stay away from this.  •   Artificial gravity:   This idea stems largely from sci -  ence fiction movies and television shows. Simply  put, it’s a lot easier to film people walking around  a spaceship just like they do on Earth, rather than  try to simulate the effects of zero-g. Unfortunately,  artificial gravity created through gravity genera -  tors, floor plates, or some other incredibly conve -  nient and equally improbable method is probably  going to remain a sci-fi writer’s fantasy for a long  time to come. Since you’re making a roleplaying  game and don’t have to worry about the limits of  filming in zero-g, this is also easy to avoid.  •   Time travel:   Besides being a major headache when  creating a plot for your game, anything involving  time travel is incredibly theoretical.  •   Teleportation:   Like artificial gravity, teleportation  got its start in science fiction as a way for television  shows to save money (in this case, to teleport onto  a planet’s surface without showing a shuttle take off  and land).   As such, we’re unlikely to be beamed  from place to place anytime soon.  Overall, if the technology you want to use feels  exactly like magic, it’s probably too advanced for a tra -  ditional science fiction setting. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 173  e xa M ple   s etting :   a ndroid  A great example of a setting that is on the “harder”  end of the science fiction spectrum is Fantasy  Flight Games’ very own   Android   universe.   Android  depicts a not-so-distant future where the world has  changed—but people have not.  Atop the highest peak on the equator, in the heart  of the largest city the Earth has ever seen, a glittering  tower of buckyweave stretches into the heavens. The  Beanstalk—a space elevator reaching into orbit around  the Earth—has unlocked the solar system and trans -  formed it into a brave new frontier for humanity. Mars  and the Moon have both been colonized, and spaceships  explore the asteroid belt and beyond. From the Moon  flows a constant stream of helium-3, a rare isotope used  in the fusion reactors that now power the solar system.  That incredible wealth has created New Angeles, a vast  megapolis sprawling across tens of thousands of square  kilometers of South America where hundreds of mil -  lions of people live. New Angeles is the largest, grandest,  richest, poorest, most splendid, and most awful city in  all the worlds. It is diverse, sophisticated, and powerful,  while also wracked by corruption, unrest, and crime.  The worlds of   Android   are linked together by the  Network, a web of information that links nearly every  device (and by extension, every person) on the planet.  The Network arose from the ashes of the old Internet.  Instead of linking computers, the Network links every  electronic device using universal gateway protocols  and encryptions. Secure, fast, and nearly indestructible,  the Network truly is the digital frontier imagined by  twentieth-century futurists. And just like on any fron -  tier, lawlessness reigns on the fringes. Hackers known  as runners haunt the Network, breaking into corporate  records, stealing from bank accounts, and liberating  secret information. With a system as pervasive as the  Network, these criminals could be anyone, anywhere.  Most importantly, the   Android   setting has recently  seen the introduction of true androids, or artificial  humans. These come in two forms: clones and bioroids  (humanoid robots). An invention known as braintap -  ing allows these androids to be given human thoughts  and personalities. Crucially, however, they’re still owned  by the corporations that created them. Earth, Luna,  and Mars teeter on the edge of a revolution as androids  increasingly dominate the workforce and leave millions  of humans jobless. At the same time, people are starting  to wrestle with the question, “Just how human are these  androids, and should they be treated as property at all?” Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Because robots are built to meet certain speci -  fications, we gave the bioroid low starting characteris -  tics but a lot of experience. That way, you can custom -  ize your characteristics and skills to represent any of  the different “models” of   bioroid.  s pecies   a bilities  •  3   1   1   1   1   1  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Wound Threshold:   11+Brawn  •   Strain Threshold:   8+Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   155 XP  •   Special Abilities:   Bioroids do not need to eat, sleep,  or breathe, and are unaffected by toxins and poisons.  Bioroids do not reduce their strain threshold when  they receive cybernetics (in the case of bioroids, the  cybernetics can represent upgraded mechanical  components instead of true cybernetics).  •   Inorganic:   Since   bioroids   are   inorganic,   they  do not gain the benefits of healing wounds with  painkillers or a Medicine check. Bioroids can heal  wounds and strain naturally by resting, as their  systems attempt self-repairs. Bioroids can also be  “healed” by using the Mechanics skill instead of  the Medicine skill, but otherwise following the  guidelines detailed on page   116 .  c lone  This profile is of a human   clone. We assume this is a  corporation-produced clone that has been tailored for  a certain job (otherwise, if this were an unmodified  clone, you could simply use the average human profile  on page   36 ). Like bioroids, clones have customiza -  tion options to represent their “designed” nature, but  in their case, we did this by giving a clone focused skill  options, but less experience. The “A Face in the Crowd”  rule represents a clone blending into an urban set -  ting (after all, they look exactly like a bunch of other  clones), but may have to deal with anti-clone bias.  s pecies   a bilities  •  2   2   2   2   2   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Wound Threshold:   11+Brawn  •   Strain Threshold:   10+Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   80 XP  •   Special Abilities:   You may select two skills when  creating a clone character.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 175  s etting - s pe C ifi C   g ear  T he   following   are   some   examples   of   weapons,  armor, and gear that may be unique to a science  fiction setting. This is not supposed to be an exhaustive  list by any means; it should instead serve as inspiration  when you create your setting, particularly if you make  your own weapons (see page   197 ).  You should also use some or all of the gear from the  modern day   setting in this setting, since any near-future  settings are still going to have a lot of modern day tech.  W eapons  In each entry, we explain why the weapon has some of  the characteristics and item qualities it does. For exam -  ple, a laser pistol has the Burn quality because we think  it reasonable that a laser could light a target on fire. We  do this so that when building your own gear (a laser  cannon, perhaps?), you know what characteristics help  define the gear as that particular type of gear, and what  characteristics are more flexible.  f lechette   p istol   an D   l auncher  The flechette pistol uses electromagnetic coils to fire  bursts of tiny metal spears called flechettes. These  benefit from significant penetrative power and can  sometimes punch straight through an opponent (rep -  resented by the Pierce 2 quality), but they don’t have a  great deal of stopping power (hence the lower damage).  Since each shot is actually a burst of several flechettes,  the low Crit rating and Vicious 2 quality represent the  high chance of internal damage. The flechette launcher  is a larger, heavier version of the pistol, similar to a  shotgun in that it fires larger bursts of flechettes (hence  the Blast 4 and higher Vicious quality).  l aser   p istol   an D   r ifle  Laser weapons fire a beam of coherent light, caus -  ing damage through intense, searing heat. In this set -  ting, we’re assuming that handheld lasers are still being  refined, so these early models have some drawbacks. One  issue with laser weapons is beam diffusion over long dis -  tances, which is why our laser weapons are relatively short  ranged. These lasers don’t have a lot of penetration, since  they expend their energy on the surface of whatever they  hit, so no Pierce. But they are very accurate and can light  targets on fire, hence the Accurate and Burn qualities.  G   auss   r ifle  A gauss rifle uses an electromagnetic rail or coil to hurl a  metal projectile over a long distance at incredible speed.  The main drawback of this weapon is that it takes some  time to recharge its capacitors after firing, so we gave it  Slow-Firing (it’s also important to do this for balance  reasons, since this weapon is very powerful). We gave it  Cumbersome as well, so a character needs to be strong to  carry it around, or must use a bipod (see page   207 ).  m icro   - m issile   l auncher  One thing we can expect in the future is the further min -  iaturization of computers, which leads us to the micro-  missile launcher.

The tracking ability comes with the Guided quality  (and the time to lock onto a target is represented by the  Prepare quality). As with the gauss rifle, a weapon this  powerful needs drawbacks to compensate, which are the  weapon’s high Cumbersome rating and encumbrance.  m onobla D e   k nife  This is an age-old weapon with a futuristic twist, a knife  given an impossibly sharp edge through materials sci -  ences. This is just like the knife on page   91 , except that  this knife has a better Crit rating and the Pierce quality;  it can cut through tough materials and is more likely  to inflict deadly wounds. If you want to make a mono -  blade sword (or katana), up the damage to +3, give it the  Defensive 1 quality, and multiply the price by 2.  s tun   b aton  This is supposed to be a slightly more futuristic version  of a police riot club, a weapon that shocks opponents into  submission. One thing to note is that even though this is  a Melee weapon, it doesn’t add your character’s Brawn  to the damage (signified by the lack of a “+” before the  damage value). Since the weapon discharges an electric  shock whenever it touches an opponent, how hard your  character swings it doesn’t matter. Also, this weapon is  non-lethal, so it has the Stun Damage quality.  a rmor  Flak vests from the   modern day   setting are very appro -  priate for a sci-fi setting. Meanwhile, we’ve turned our  focus to more futuristic protection.  p lasteel   c arapace  Made from semifuturistic materials, a suit of plas -  teel carapace armor completely covers your character  from head to toe, and with the right attachments can  even be environmentally sealed. The armor has a rigid  outer shell that deflects or blocks incoming attacks  (represented by the reasonably high soak value and a  defense value).  o ptical   c amo   s uit  An optical camo suit plays with the idea that holo -  graphic projectors and other similar technologies will,  in the future, allow people to wear armor that “cloaks”  them and makes them invisible to the naked eye. Our  optical camo suit doesn’t quite go that far, but it does  use holoprojectors to blur and obscure the wearer,  making them much harder to hit (hence the defense  value). Unfortunately, the complicated projector tech  doesn’t do much if someone manages to land a lucky  blow, which is why this armor has no soak value. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 177  G ear  Most of the items on pages   93   and   168   work for this  setting, but the following items may be unique to sci-fi.  c yber   - r i G  Hackers use cyber-rigs to delve deep into the Internet (or  its equivalent) and defeat the most dangerous firewalls  and programs. These things are big, with multiple moni -  tor screens, towers full of electronics, and countless wires.  A cyber-rig does everything a personal computer  does. It also adds automatic   󲊳   to any checks made to  hack into protected servers, and adds automatic   󲊰   to  any checks by opponents to hack into its own systems.  pa D  Personal access devices (PADs) are small, handheld  computers not too dissimilar to today’s smartphones and  tablets (although their capabilities are notably superior).  A PAD does everything you would expect a personal  computer to do, just slightly faster and more easily.  c ybernetics  Although modern cybernetics can give a disabled indi -  vidual a replacement for a missing extremity, in the  future they may do much more. These cybernetics are  special pieces of gear that must be installed on a char -  acter with an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Medicine check . They  cannot be removed without surgery, requiring a second  successful   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Medicine check.  Thematically, cybernetics are supposed to enhance a  character, so the ones presented here increase a char -  acter’s derived stats, skills, or characteristics. To avoid  letting increases get out of control, each stat, skill, or  characteristic can only be increased by +1 due to cyber -  netics, no matter how many different cybernetics your  character has that would increase that number.  c ybernetic   a rm   or   l e G  Besides replacing a missing limb, a cybernetic arm or  leg adds +1 to your character’s Brawn or Agility rating  (your choice when your character obtains the limb). If  your character has one or more cybernetic arms, they  decrease their strain threshold by one, and if they have  one or more cybernetic legs, they decrease their strain  threshold by one.  s kulljack  A skulljack is a cerebral point that allows your char -  acter to access a computer with their mind. As long as  the skulljack is linked to a computer (either wired or  wirelessly), it increases your character’s Intellect rating  by one. If your character has a skulljack, they decrease  their strain threshold by one.  c ybereyes  Cybernetic eyes provide +1 rank to your character’s  Perception and Vigilance, and remove   󲊸   added to their  checks due to darkness. If your character has one or more  cybereyes, they decrease their strain threshold by one.  i mplant   a rmor  Implant armor is added beneath your character’s skin,  giving them discreet protection. Implant armor pro -  vides +1 soak. If your character has implant armor, they  decrease their strain threshold by one.  c yberor G ans  Cyberorgans allow individuals to survive heart disease, lung  cancer, and other deadly ailments. However, these devices  also can be bought as implants that improve performance.  A cyberorgan provides either +2 wound threshold (this  is a special exception to the +1 increase limit, but cannot  be increased past +2), +1 Resilience, or +1 Athletics (you  choose when you buy the organ). For each cyberorgan your  character has, they decrease their strain threshold by one.

An exosuit increases the character’s  Brawn, soak, and wound threshold, which we’ve incor -  porated into the profile stats and noted in the equipment.

CHAPTER 6:   SPACE OPERA  A t its simplest, space opera could be thought of as  science fiction that’s heavy on the adventure and  light on the actual science. Space opera, at least origi -  nally, was defined by what it’s not—hard science fiction.  Although the term was initially meant as a disparaging  label, fans and creators have embraced it in the decades  since it first came into use.  Although it’s not the only type of soft science fiction,  space opera definitely falls toward that side of the spec -  trum. There’s no reason you can’t incorporate some scien -  tific rigor into your space opera setting, despite the term’s  origins. For it to truly feel like space opera, though, the  focus should be on your characters and the adventure, not  the science behind your setting’s advanced technologies.  t ropes  S pace opera takes the tropes of hard science fiction  that we discuss on page   170   and tosses them aside,  but there are some other tropes we think help make  a setting feel like space opera. Of course, this list isn’t  complete, and much of what defines space opera is  open to debate. However, if you set out to run a space  opera game, we think you’ll find many of these tropes  naturally fall into place.  G ran D   s tories ,   s in G ular   h eroes ,   h i G h   s takes  Most space opera stories focus on small groups of  plucky heroes and their actions, which are likely to  have a noticeable impact even at the huge scales found  in many settings. The protagonists might not seem like  important people; although they could be royalty or  military leaders, they could just as easily be small-time  outlaws or ordinary people caught up in events.  The scope of a space opera setting is often immense.  It’s not uncommon for the action, or even a unified  government, to stretch across an entire galaxy. In some  cases, characters might travel from one end of the galaxy  to the other in a relatively short time. Space opera set -  tings are huge not only in a physical sense, but often in a  historical sense as well. Space operas often include civili -  zations that have been around for centuries or millennia.  Even space opera stories with a limited scope are likely  to feature high stakes, at least relative to the scale. A  setting that encompasses a galaxy might see the heroes  facing threats to that entire galaxy, whether we’re talk -  ing complete destruction or merely utter subjugation by  an evil regime. Not all space opera settings or stories are  so big, though. What matters is that the risks and dan -  gers facing your characters make for high drama and  excitement. It’s perfectly possible to have a space opera  campaign, if not an entire setting, take place within a  single solar system. Just make sure that you scale the  stakes appropriately: if the setting is a star system, then  the stakes can be the fate of that star system.  Always think big.  i mpossible   t echnolo G y ?  n o   b i G   D eal  Unlike in hard science fiction,  in   space   opera   technology   is  rarely a focus, although at the  same   time,   it   is   impossibly  advanced. It exists to serve  the story, but it doesn’t drive  the story. Characters likely  use exciting but implausible  weapons, such as laser pistols  that fire visible and explosive  beams, energy swords that can  cut through anything, and rifles  that disintegrate targets. Flying  cars, force fields, tractor beams,  invisibility devices, planet-destroy -  ing weapons, and other such marvels  are introduced because they are cool  and help the story, not because they  are a logical extrapolation of current  scientific developments.  A common example is faster-than-  light travel, a staple of space opera  settings. It’s necessary in order to  tell the sweeping, galaxy-spanning Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 180  stories space opera is known for, but any explana -  tion of its function tends to be cursory and certainly  can’t hold up to any sort of scrutiny. It may rely on  fantastical assumptions such as a parallel universe or  a miraculous—yet readily available—fuel source. The  speed of interstellar travel varies between settings, and  may have some basis in the explanation behind the  technology. Ultimately, however, travel in space operas  tends to be as fast or slow as the story needs for the best  dramatic effect. You might explain it as gravity fluctua -  tions, particle storms, or some inherent unpredictabil -  ity of the technology, but don’t worry about defining  the travel time between various planets in your setting  (unless you really want to).  b roa D   s trokes   for   a   b i GG er   c anvas  To allow for the sense of grand scale common to space  opera, facets of the setting are often covered in a sim -  plified, brief fashion. This includes planets dominated  by a single, recognizable ecosystem—desert worlds,  ice worlds, and so on—as well as a single alien species.  While humans likely show much of the diversity they  do in reality, alien races tend to abide by cultural and  personality traits across their entire home planet and  beyond, with the potential for rare exceptions. Even  humans are likely bound by planetary or galaxy-wide  governments and cultures, in stark contrast to the frac -  tious civilization of present-day Earth. Though unre -  alistic, these convenient simplifications make it pos -  sible to tell stories encompassing numerous intelligent  species and countless star systems without collapsing  under the weight of details. Space opera is about drama  and story, not minutia.  Governments and other such organizations are often  covered in similarly broad strokes. In space opera, it’s  not uncommon for an empire to rule over the known  galaxy, or at least those planets inhabited by humans.  a liens   an D   a n D roi D s  Many space opera settings feature a variety of intelligent  humanoids that aren’t quite human. Intelligent machines  and humanlike aliens are probably the most common,  but mutants, genetically engineered hybrids, holograms,  and anything else you might imagine are also possible.  These entities usually have very human personalities,  and language barriers are rarely an issue unless they  serve an important part of the plot. Depending on the  setting, these various beings might be insular and live  apart, or commingle across the galaxy. Regardless, they  are certain to interact at some level, and interspecies  diplomacy might be a large part of the story.  This is one of the great concessions space opera  makes in placing the story and excitement over realism.  In reality, extraterrestrial life—should it exist at all—is  pretty unlikely to resemble humanity. In space opera,  however, not only do aliens frequently look and act  like us, but they even emulate distinctly recognizable  human cultures. This approach may require some sus -  pension of disbelief, but it avoids many of the obstacles  that can arise from a more realistic treatment. It also  ensures that non-human characters are relatable not  only to the audience (or players, in the case of an RPG),  but to the humans—and other aliens—within the set -  ting. From a roleplaying game standpoint, it’s fun to  have the option to play an alien, and keeping them very  human-like makes it easier to get in character.  Of course, this isn’t to say your space opera setting  shouldn’t also include incomprehensible, utterly inhu -  man alien beings. The horror and revulsion such crea -  tures might inspire can even be elevated by the com -  monality of human-like aliens. If the laws of nature  across the galaxy have resulted in humanoids, where  did this energy cloud that defies all attempts at com -  munication come from?  t his   s eems   f amiliar  Often, space opera settings feature familiar tropes from  other genres. This likely stems from space opera’s favor -  ing of adventure and excitement over scientific accuracy.  Whether it takes place in the future or another galaxy  altogether, a space opera setting might feature elements  that would be right at home in a Western, medieval  fantasy adventure, detective story, or just about any -  thing else. A space opera setting could include duty-  bound, star-faring knights or desperadoes with high-  tech revolvers. Characters might wield advanced melee  weapons, even though the guns are equally advanced  and feature all the advantages guns always do in a knife  fight. Depending on the setting, plausible explanations  might be provided for such anachronisms, or they might  simply come down to the Rule of Cool. (See page   165  for more on this very important law of gaming.)  One advantage this trope has for you as a GM is that  you can borrow liberally from your favorite movies,  books, and video games. By changing the details, you  can insert characters, places, and even whole stories  without your players recognizing them. A stagecoach  robbery can become an attack on a spaceship. A hidden  temple full of lizard people and magic items becomes,  well, a hidden temple on another planet, inhabited by  lizard-like aliens guarding ancient technology from the  height of their civilization.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 181  e xa M ple   s etting :   t wilight   i M periu M  F antasy Flight Games’   Twilight   Imperium   is a  prime example of a space opera setting.   Twilight  Imperium   presents an epic panorama of competing  civilizations vying to establish a new interstellar empire.  It has been more than three millennia since the fall of  the Lazax Empire and the Great Scourge that eradicated  the onetime rulers of the galaxy. The intervening Dark  Years are finally drawing to a close, as the great races  recommit to the Galactic Council and step forward  from their fortified borders to reestablish trade and  recolonize the neighboring worlds that perished in the  conflict. But this is no dawning age of peace and coop -  eration. Even as a score of stellar nations retake their  seats on the Council, these great races scheme against  each other and skirmish along interstellar borders and  on unclaimed worlds. It’s clear to all that each of these  factions has its eyes on the throne of a new empire.  In the Twilight Wars, the ancient capital of the Lazax  Empire, Mecatol Rex, was bombarded and blasted  beyond recognition. Yet the greatest persisting damage  wasn’t inflicted by Sol dreadnoughts, but by the Lazax  councilor who set afire the Hall of Cartography before  fleeing with the handful of Lazax who heeded his warn -  ing of the threat facing the Empire. Due to the destruc -  tion of those records and the ensuing decline, no reli -  able maps of the galaxy exist today. Despite countless  thousands of years of exploration and colonization, in  many ways it is as if the great races were stepping out  among the stars for the first time.  While the Federation of Sol is still seen as a young  upstart by many of the elder races, none have forgot -  ten the key role it played in the destruction of the Lazax  Empire. In the years since, the Federation has fortified its  ancestral territories, and now it strikes out in a new era  of colonization. Humans may live throughout the galaxy,  but those of the Federation of Sol have a unique sense of  purpose, seeing it as their destiny to rule the stars.  The Emirates of Hacan were among the few to main -  tain contact with the other great races during the Dark  Years, continuing in their role as traders and merchants.  This continued contact has put them in an advantageous  position to call upon alliances, to say nothing of the  information they have collected in the intervening cen -  turies. As a faction and a people, the Hacan prefer diplo -  macy and commerce over war and bloodshed, but they  are more than ready to fight to protect their interests.  Only the warlike Letnev could be said to have played a  bigger part in the ignition of the Twilight Wars, through  their blockade of the Quann wormhole. Always belli -  cose, the Barony has eagerly rebuilt its forces since the  Twilight Wars in anticipation of a new age of conquest.  The Xxcha Kingdom, the first great interstellar civili -  zation, was entirely pacifist prior to the Letnev invasion  of its twin capital worlds of Archon Ren and Archon  Tau during the Twilight Wars. Although unable to  openly resist at the time, the Xxcha have since devel -  oped their military technology and forces to ensure  they can defend against aggression.

The Ghosts of Creuss only recently revealed them -  selves to the wider galaxy, though they are now believed  to have been responsible for numerous disappearances  of vessels in the region of the Creuss Gate. Since joining  the Galactic Council, however, the Creuss have been  nothing but diplomatic and respectful—if enigmatic.  Little is known of these bizarre energy beings, except  that their near-supernatural affinity for wormholes can  provide them with great influence and power in an  upcoming conflict.  Even as these and the other would-be rulers of  the galaxy attempt to outmaneuver each other at the  negotiating table and in naval actions, the Lazax have  returned from extinction, now calling themselves the  L1z1x. It’s unclear how much these cold cyborgs really  have in common with their imperial ancestors.  But while the great races vie for the throne, another  force seeks not conquest, but utter annihilation. The  Nekro Virus is an omniphagic biotechnological plague,  adapting and incorporating the technology of its victims  even as it destroys all biological life in its path. If the Nekro  Virus triumphs, there won’t be a galaxy left to rule.  n ew   s tarting   C hara C ter   o ptions  M ost space opera settings are home to many intel -  ligent species with comparable levels of technol -  ogy. Humans are often the most numerous and diverse  of the great races, but the humanlike personalities and  motivations of most space opera aliens make them per -  fect fits for player characters. The species presented here  are generic versions of common tropes, and they can be  customized to fit your own setting.  a nimalistic   a lien  Space opera settings often have alien species that are  derivative of some terrestrial species. Fiction abounds  with catlike aliens, turtle-like aliens, reptilian aliens,  and so forth. Traditionally, these species are stronger,  faster, or tougher than humans, and they share some  traits with the nonsapient Terran species they mimic.  Our animalistic alien species is stronger and faster than  most average humans, but trades this for fewer starting  XP. The physical appearance of this species is, of course,  up to you.  s pecies   a bilities  •  3   3   2   2   1   2  BRAWN   AGILITY   INTELLECT   CUNNING   WILLPOWER   PRESENCE  Wound Threshold:   10+Brawn  •   Strain Threshold:   8+Willpower  •   Starting Experience:   80 XP  •   Special Abilities:   An animalistic alien starts with  one rank in Athletics, Coordination, or Resilience  during character creation.

We made our psionic alien with a formi -  dable Willpower and Intellect, with the tradeoff of being  extremely physically weak. However, what your charac -  ter gets in return are three unique abilities allowing them  to read minds, manipulate emotions, and even harm  opponents with a thought. What a   psionic alien looks  like is up to you. Traditionally, they tend to be physically  frail—withered bodies with oversized heads, or spin -  dly creatures with  fragile limbs and  etherial grace. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 184  s etting - s pe C ifi C   g ear  I n this section, we have an assortment of advanced  equipment the likes of which you might find in a  space opera setting. This is really only a starting point—  space opera settings can encompass any sort of tech -  nology imaginable, and that applies to weapons, armor,  and other gear PCs might use as much as anything else.  To help you in creating additional items for your game  (see page   197 ), we’ve included some notes on why we  gave these items the profiles we did.  W eapons  In addition to these, most of the weapons from the   sci -  ence fiction   setting could find a place in a space opera  campaign, at least among backwater worlds with a  lower technological base.  a ssault   c annon  This is the evolution of modern day autocannons and  heavy machine guns. It may or may not feature mul -  tiple rotating barrels, or use explosive or armor-pierc -  ing shells, but the end result is much the same, since  we are assuming the explosive radius isn’t enough to  justify the Blast quality. Instead, the Pierce and Vicious  qualities combine with high damage to make a weapon  that’s probably overkill against infantry and enough to  threaten light vehicles.  G   rena D e   l obber  We’ve given this grenade launcher a profile reflecting a  standard grenade. If you use a different kind of grenade  (such as the particle grenade), change the damage and  Crit ratings accordingly, and add the relevant qualities  (you wouldn’t change the launcher’s Limited Ammo  quality, for instance). Although this weapon is similar  to a modern-day grenade launcher, sophisticated tar -  geting systems help the user fire at the right trajectory  to hit even distant targets, hence the long range and  Accurate quality.  l aser   p istol   ,   r ifle   ,   an D   c annon  These weapons fire beams of energy, which is really  all the explanation you need in a space opera setting.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 185  Unlike the laser weapons presented in the hard science  fiction setting on page   175 , we assume these weapons  are sophisticated enough that diffusion over distance  isn’t a problem. We also decided that the focused beams  of these weapons can easily punch holes in armor,  hence the Pierce (or even Breach) quality.  p article   G   rena D e  This grenade releases a blast of highly energized par -  ticles that disrupt the nervous systems of most organic  creatures. For this sci-fi take on the classic stun gre -  nade, we figured the particles have a potent enough  effect to leave the target dazed even once they regain  control of their body, represented by a higher Disorient  rating in addition to Concussive.  p lasma   p istol   ,   r ifle   ,   an D   c annon  These weapons all fire spherical bolts of high-energy  ionized   gas.   The   exact   chemicals   and   technology  involved are sure to differ between manufacturers  and species, but the result is devastating, superheated  energy projectiles. Even the larger weapons in this cat -  egory have a fairly limited range, since we figure the  electromagnetic   field   generated   for   each   projectile  can only maintain its coherency for a short time. The  bolts of superheated gas leave flesh sizzling and armor  smoldering, hence the Burn quality. The largest weap -  ons—plasma cannons—need time to cool down after  each shot (hence the Slow-Firing quality).  s hu DD er   b la D e  This weapon is essentially a combat knife with a car -  bon alloy blade that vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency,  allowing it to slice through even the strongest mate -  rials. These traits are represented with the Pierce and  Vicious qualities as well as a good Crit rating, giving  the weapon a chance to inflict significant injuries on  even armored targets.  s liver   r ocket   l auncher  A sliver rocket launcher is named for the appearance of  its narrow, supersonic projectiles. Sliver rockets don’t have  an explosive payload, but their armor-piercing warheads  are immensely effective against even the toughest vehicles.  We’ve given the weapon Breach to account for the dev -  astating effects of impact against both vehicles and flesh.  s lu G   p istol   an D   r ifle  Despite thousands of years of innovation, handguns and  rifles that chemically propel solid metal bullets remain a  mainstay of fighting forces.

GENESYS  Part Ii: settings 186  a rmor  Space opera armor can be very effective and exotic,  with force fields and powered systems.  e lite   s hock   a rmor  Elite shock armor is the kind of horribly effective, hor -  ribly expensive armor that governments and armies  only give to their very best soldiers. These might be  marines assigned to board enemy starships, commando  raiders sent behind enemy lines on the most dangerous  missions, or the elite bodyguards of powerful emperors  and rulers.  When wearing this armor, characters increase their  Brawn by 1, to a maximum of 5 (this does increase their  soak value) and count their encumbrance capacity as  10+Brawn. This armor is also environmentally sealed,  meaning that it counts as a space suit (see the next page).  i nfantry   c ombat   a rmor  The combat armor used by foot soldiers of various  interplanetary governments is pretty similar across  the galaxy, providing a solid soak value with minimal  encumbrance.  If you are using the hard point customization rules  (see page   206 ), infantry combat armor has three hard  points (instead of the usual one).  p ersonal   f orce   f iel D  Force fields are a mainstay of space opera sci-fi, although  in many settings they are primarily or exclusively used  to protect ships and other large targets. The sophisti -  cated technology and high power draw mean that per -  sonal force fields are rare and expensive. Mechanically,  a high defense is less predictable than soak, but has the  potential to cause otherwise successful attacks to fail.  G ear  Most gear in a space opera setting is actually very simi -  lar to the gear you might see in other settings, but with  a fancier aesthetic and more flashing lights.  c omm   - b ea D  This communications device fits into a sentient’s ear (or  other auditory orifice) and allows them to communi -  cate with friends and allies within 100 kilometers.

Under normal conditions, a character using the sen -  sor automatically detects any moving creatures within  medium range. Of course, it can’t distinguish friend from  foe or identify the creatures. If creatures within range are  actively hidden, your character adds   󲊸   󲊸   to Vigilance  or Perception checks to notice them while using the  motion sensor (instead of spotting them automatically).

Basically, this means your character can  talk to their computer and it answers back. The AI isn’t as  smart as an average person, and its “weak” status means  it can’t learn or evolve, but it does everything a modern  computer can do and can even allow futuristic hackers  to access and attempt to override security systems.  In addition to functioning as a personal computer,  the smart-system has information stores that allow the  wearer to add   󲊸   to any Intellect-based checks they make.  s pace   s uit  Space suits are a must in every space opera setting.  After all, one of the mainstays of the setting is traveling  through space. They all do roughly the same thing: keep  the wearer alive in a vacuum.  Generally, space suits include the following: multi -  directional maneuvering thrusters, a built-in light, a  communications device, magnetic-soled boots, and  an emergency repair kit that allows the user to fix  any small leaks or tears as a maneuver. The space  suit also allows the wearer to survive in vacuum for  up to four hours.  s etting - s pe C ifi C   a dversaries  A ny space opera setting is bound to be a big place with  an almost limitless variety of potential adversar -  ies for PCs.

Besides  rules for beefing up your nemeses and unlink -  ing skills from characteristics, we also have rules  for magic, futuristic hacking, playing games with  vehicles and spaceships, and customizing weapons  and armor.  •   Chapter 3: Build an Adventure.   This chapter gives  you some advice on how to build your own adven -  ture. We talk about conflicts for your PCs, types of  adversity, and encounter structure.  •   Chapter 4: Tones.   Tones can work in any setting  and are an additional layer of detail you can add  to your game. Changing the character of the game  you’re running, tones include pulp, horror, mys -  tery, intrigue, romance and drama, and superhe -  roes. All of these sections include advice on how to  incorporate that tone into your game. Some of the  sections also include special rules, such as fear and  sanity rules in the horror section.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 190  CHAPTER 1: CUSTOMIZING RULES  N ow that you know the core and setting-specific  rules, you might want to customize the game with  your own unique skills, species, archetypes, talents,  items, or adversaries.  As you create your own rules, keep in mind that the  guidelines we provide here are intended to be just that:  guidelines. There’s a lot that goes into making a role -  playing game, and we cannot cover all the aspects of  game development in these pages. What we can do is  give you a good starting point. We hope you take what  we tell you here and run with it. As you spend more  time tweaking, modifying, and creating your rules,  you’re going to learn more about the entire process.  Just keep two things in mind as you go forward.  1.   Don’t assume the initial reaction to something  you’ve created is the “right” reaction. Always test  a rule in play before you make a final judgement  about whether it works or not.  2.   Don’t be afraid to scrap something that isn’t working.  C reate   a   s kill  W e already defined and explained   skills (if you  missed this, check out page   52   in   Part I ).  However, even though our list is fairly extensive, we  expect you may want to create some additional skills  for your own game.  Desi G nin G   a   s kill  The first thing to keep in mind is that skills are pretty  simple. Since a skill is a measure of a character’s ability  to complete a certain type of task, creating a new skill  just requires you to define a task you want characters to  accomplish. For example, let’s say you want to measure  how well characters in your game swim. You create a  new skill, Swim.  c haracteristic   l ink  Once you create a skill, you need to decide what char -  acteristic the skill links to. This characteristic helps  determine the dice pool when a character makes a  check using your new skill. Thus, you need to pick the  characteristic that makes the most thematic sense for  the skill at hand.  Going back to our example, let’s look at our new  Swim skill. Consider the six characteristics in the  game: Brawn, Agility, Intellect, Cunning, Willpower,  and Presence. Being a good swimmer relies on physi -  cal fitness and conditioning, so we can immediately  narrow it down to two characteristics, Brawn and Agil -  ity. Between the two of them, Agility depicts more a  measure of manual dexterity, hand-eye coordination,  reflexes,   and   precision.   Brawn   measures   physical  strength, stamina, and conditioning. Swimming fits  better with the latter, so we’ll link it to Brawn.  Sometimes, you may think of multiple characteris -  tics that make sense with your new skill. Often, this is  because there may be multiple approaches to accom -  plishing the task your skill lets characters execute. For  example, maybe your Fly Drones skill should be linked  to Agility because piloting things remotely requires  hand-eye coordination and reflexes, or maybe it should  be linked to Intellect because it requires using a com -  puter. In cases like this, pick the one you feel fits better.  If both seem to work equally well, consider the number  of other skills linked to each characteristic, and pick the  characteristic that has fewer skills linked to it.  t he   D   o   an D   D   on   ’   t   l ist  Once you’ve created the skill, write up a brief descrip -  tion of when characters will use this skill. You want to  define this so that your players know what they’re get -  ting if they buy this skill for their characters!  One of the best ways to communicate a skill’s uses is  to create Should and Should Not lists. These provide  examples of when a character should use this skill and  when they should not use it (and what they should be  doing instead). Generally, your lists should have at least  three entries. If they don’t, then the one or two entries  you have better be situations that come up quite often  in your game! Otherwise, people aren’t going to feel the  skill is worth investing XP in.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 191  t hin G s   to   c onsi D er   W hen   c reatin G   a   s kill  Think of these as guidelines to help make sure your  skill is useful in your game.  D   oes   a nother   s kill   a lrea D y   D   o   t his   ?  When you create a skill, think about the skills that  already exist in your game. Ask yourself if any other  skills already do what your skill does.  Going back to our previous example of the Swim skill,  consider that the Athletics skill already exists. Normally,  this skill covers swimming. If you add the Swim skill to  your game, you create a situation where your players can  buy a very specific skill for their characters—or they can  buy a skill that lets their characters accomplish a wider  variety of tasks, including the task your new skill focuses  on. So why would anyone take ranks in Swim?  There are a few ways to address this situation.  •   Don’t Use the New Skill:   This is the simplest and  most obvious solution. Generally, if there’s not a  good reason to create a new skill, it’s better not to.  •   Eliminate the Old Skill:   This happens in most set -  tings that have two separate Ranged or Melee skills  for different types of weapons. We get rid of the old  skill, and replace it with two or more new skills.  Just keep in mind that if you do this, you need to  make sure the new skills cover everything the old  skill did. Also, remember this increases the total  number of skills, so watch out for skill bloat.  •   Eliminate the Particular Use in the Old Skill:   This  is pretty similar to the previous solution, actually.  Rewrite the old skill so that it doesn’t cover the task  that you want your new skill to perform (you still  need to consider the previous issues).  h o W   u seful   i s   t his   in   m y   G   ame   ?  When developing a new skill, think about how your  group’s characters are going to use it in the game. Try  to imagine when and where they’ll use it. Speak to  your players, and ask them what kind of adventures  they want to participate in. What they want to do in  the game can be a good guide as to what skills they’ll  want to invest in. Finally, consider the setting. Is the  skill appropriate for the setting? A science fiction set -  ting doesn’t need a Woodcarving skill any more than a  fantasy setting needs the Computers skill.  t oo   b roa D  When you create a skill, you need to make sure that the  skill isn’t so broad that it lets the character accomplish  too wide a range of tasks. You don’t want to create one  skill that’s mechanically “better” to invest in than all the  others, lest your players all invest their experience into  that one skill.  t oo   f ocuse D  Unlike a skill that is too broad, one that is too focused  on a specific kind of task won’t break your game. How -  ever, your players won’t be very interested in using the  skill. We consider a skill to be too focused when oppor -  tunities for using it come up less than once every other  session. In cases like that, your players will quickly stop  investing experience points into advancing the skill.  Sometimes it can be hard to notice when a skill is too  focused or too broad. You may have to put the skill in  the hands of your players and let them try it out.  c ountin G   s kill / c haracteristic   l inks  When developing skills, you need to keep in mind how  many are linked to each characteristic, and how use -  ful those skills are. After all, since PCs and NPCs don’t  make characteristic checks, linked skills determine  how useful characteristics are. Generally, make sure no  one characteristic has too many linked skills. However,  if a skill is particularly useful and comes up a lot, its  characteristic can have fewer skills linked to it overall.  s kill   b loat  When creating skills, the primary thing to avoid  is so-called “skill bloat.” Skill bloat is a problem  games can develop when they have a very long  skill list, and each skill lets a character perform  a very specific task. If the list is too long and the  tasks are too specific, a player may buy a rank in  a skill, only to find that their character doesn’t  use that skill for several game sessions. This is  going to be frustrating for the player who feels  like the investment of XP wasn’t worth it.  Skill bloat also means players must keep track  of a wider variety of skills. This is problem -  atic for players trying to figure out what skill  is most appropriate for a check. It also makes  things harder for GMs, who now must try to  include more chances to use a wider range of  skills in their adventures, so that those skills  seem relevant.  That’s skill bloat. However, if you consider the  points we lay out in this section, you should be  able to avoid it. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 192  C reate   a   s pe C ies   or   a r C hetype  D epending on the setting you’re using, quite a few  species or   archetypes could be available to players.  This book barely scratches the surface of the available  options, and that’s just when you consider our settings.  If you’re creating your own setting, you’re undoubtedly  going to want to create your own species or archetypes  to go with it.  Before we get started, a brief note on terminology. Spe -  cies is the word we use to describe anything that’s sentient,  but not human. In a fantasy setting, your elves, dwarves,  orcs, and gnomes would all be different species. In a sci-fi  setting, your intelligent aliens are all different species.  Archetypes are what we call different types of humans.  You see this in movies and books: the archetypical jock  or nerd, for example. Basically, it’s a specific kind of per -  son. We created archetypes so that players have charac -  ter choices in settings where everyone’s playing a human.  c reatin G   a   s pecies   or   a rchetype  One of the first things you should know is that there’s  not much of a mechanical difference between a species  and an archetype. Thematically, plenty of difference  exists, of course, but that doesn’t matter for our pur -  poses. Going forward, we’re going to simply say “spe -  cies” and know that we’re talking about either.  b asic   s pecies   p rofile  All species profiles consist of the following parts:  1.   Starting Characteristics:   These represent differ -  ent species’ general physical and mental attributes.  Most settings with different species exaggerate the  differences between those species (some are stron -  ger, some are faster, some are smarter, etc.). Differ -  ent starting characteristics also give you something  concrete to choose between at character creation.  2.   Wound Threshold:   Basically how much damage  the species can take before being incapacitated.  You always add the species’ Brawn (after spending  starting experience) to the total wound threshold.  3.   Strain Threshold:   How much stress a species can  take before passing out or capitulating. You always  add the species’ Willpower (after spending starting  experience) to the total strain threshold.  4.   Starting Experience:   How much experience you  begin with when building a character. We tie start -  ing XP into the species choice, because it is our  prime   balancing   mechanism   between   different  species. We’ll get to that more later.  5.   Special Abilities:   Almost always something that  gives your character a rank in a specific skill. The  idea is that individual species are better at some  things than they are at others. This section might  include additional rules as well, but generally those  should be saved for part six.  6.   Other Unique Rules:   Many (but not all) species have  some special rule that can’t be obtained in any other  way during the game. This rule might be something  like Amphibious (can breathe underwater without  penalty and never suffers movement penalties for  traveling through water), or perhaps something like  the Bioroid’s Inorganic rule, on page   174 . Usually  this is something intrinsic to the nature of the species.  When building a species, you should start with four  of your six characteristics (your choice) with a value  of “2,” one with a value of “1,” and one with a value  of “3.” Your wound and strain thresholds should be at  “10+Brawn” and “10+Willpower,” respectively. Your  starting experience is set to 100 XP. Finally, your spe -  cial ability is one rank in one skill.  m o D ifyin G   the   b asic   s pecies   p rofile  When modifying the profile, keep in mind how many  experience points each modification would cost (think  about   Step 4: Invest Experience Points   during charac -  ter creation). Then adjust the starting XP appropriately.  Let’s say you wanted to make the average human  archetype on page   36 . All of that archetype’s charac -  teristics start with a value of 2. If you lowered the 3 in  our framework to a 2, the species would now be miss -  ing 30 XP (the cost to raise a 2 to a 3 when purchasing  ranks in characteristics). On the other hand, you are  raising the 1 in the framework to a 2, but that’s only  the equivalent of giving our new species 20 XP (again,  the cost to raise a 1 to a 2). The species loses 30 XP and  gains 20, for a net loss of 10 XP. To compensate, you  increase the species’ starting XP from 100 to 110.  Likewise, increasing or decreasing a wound thresh -  old by two or a strain threshold by one is worth about 5  XP. If you increase a wound threshold by four or more,  or a strain threshold by two or more, it’s worth about  15 XP instead. We say “about” because these modifica -  tions don’t have to be an exact science. Sometimes, you  can make some minor adjustments (such as changing Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 193  the wound threshold by only one) without changing  the starting XP total at all.  Special abilities (as long as they’re ranks in skills)  are easy to price. A single rank in a skill is worth 5 XP,  unless that skill synergizes well with the species’ start -  ing characteristics. If the skill is linked to a characteris -  tic that starts as a 3 or higher, it’s worth 10 XP.  Other unique rules are the hardest to price out. Gen -  erally, they should be about the power level of a Tier 1  talent (see page   196 ). If they feel more powerful than  that, decrease starting XP by 5 or 10 XP to compensate.  o ther   G   ui D elines   to   k eep   in   m in D  Here are a few other things you should keep in mind as  you’re designing your species. These aren’t rules, but rather  guidelines that will help you create a species that people  are going to want to use, but won’t break your game.  W   hat   is   y our   s pecies   ’   f ocus   ?  Keep this question in mind as you’re designing your  species. Do you see this species being better in melee or  ranged combat? Social encounters? Exploration? Cer -  tain skills, characteristics, and abilities are going to be  better for different focuses. That doesn’t mean you must  make everything about your species optimized, however.  Generally, we recommend you make most of the options  mesh up with the species’ focus, but include one or two  elements that go against type. This makes a species a lot  more interesting than if it’s ruthlessly optimized.  W   oun D   an D   s train   t hreshol D s  When determining wound and strain thresholds, don’t  forget that you add Brawn and Willpower to those  values! If your species has a starting Brawn of 3, their  wound threshold is going to be a minimum of three  higher than the listed value.  When you’re making a species, you want to keep  wound and strain thresholds (with Brawn and Will -  power) somewhere between 10 and 15 for most species.  If you go slightly lower or higher for some species, you  may want to lower or raise their starting XP accordingly.  Also, we recommend only having one of the two  thresholds be high while the other is lower, or have  both of them at an average final value of 12 or 13. Hav -  ing both thresholds high would make the species seem  overpowered, while having both thresholds low would  make it seem weak.  W   hat   m akes   a   G   oo D   u ni Q ue   a bility   ?  The best unique abilities are those that define a physi -  ological element of a species that can’t be defined  through skills or talents. This includes things like the  ability to fly, breathe underwater, or not breathe the  same atmosphere as the rest of us. Most of these are  benefits, but not all, and while benefits decrease start -  ing XP, drawbacks can increase starting XP.  Here are a few example unique abilities to help you  create your own, as well as how much you should  increase or decrease starting XP by.  •   Amphibious:   This species can breathe underwater  without penalty and never suffers movement pen -  alties for traveling through water (–10 XP).  •   Exotic-Atmosphere Breather:   This species does  not breathe oxygen, but some other gas instead.  This means its members must always wear some  sort of respirator when not on their home planet.  Characters of this species start with a respirator,  and treat oxygen as a corrosive atmosphere with  rating 8 (as per page   111 ) (+10 XP).  •   Regeneration:   Whenever this species heals wounds  due to natural rest, they heal 1 additional wound.  They do not recover 1 additional wound when  receiving first aid or medical treatment. This spe -  cies can also regrow lost limbs, which takes roughly  a month before the limb is usable (–15 XP).  •   Environmentally   Adapted:   This   species   has  adapted to living in a particular climate. When  making skill checks, they may remove   󲊸   imposed  by conditions matching their native climate (–5 XP).  •   Artificial:   This species is an artificial construct. It  does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and is unaf -  fected by toxins and poisons. If you are using the  Cybernetics   rules from the science fiction setting  (see page   170 ), the first six cybernetics this spe -  cies receives do not reduce its strain threshold (the  cybernetics can represent upgraded mechanical  components instead of true cybernetics) (–10 XP).  •   Dark Vision:   This species has excellent night  vision. When making skill checks, it removes up to  󲊸   󲊸   imposed due to darkness (–5 XP).  •   Fearsome:   This species is feared in societies other  than its own. Its members add   󲊸   to Charm,  Deception, Leadership, and Negotiation checks  they make, but they add   󲊸   to Coercion checks  they make. This does not apply when interacting  with others of their own species (+5 XP).  •   Claws:   This species has claws. When making an  unarmed combat check, its members add +1 to  their base damage and have a Critical rating of 3.  (–5 XP). Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 194  C reate   a   t alent  A t this point, you’ve undoubtedly reviewed the   tal -  ents provided throughout the book. However, the  listed talents barely scratch the surface of the number of  talents that could exist. There are plenty of options for  creating new talents, and the fact that you’re reading this  section of the book indicates that you’re at least inter -  ested in creating some talents for your campaign. This  section offers a series of pointers and considerations  that should make the job a whole lot easier.  W hat   i s   a   t alent ?  A talent is, at its heart, a way for a character to break the  rules. Most of the time, your character operates accord -  ing to the rules laid down in   Chapters 1 ,   6 , and   7   in  Part I   of this book. They make skill checks, they follow  the action/maneuver limitations during combat, and  they obey the rules governing social encounters. A tal -  ent lets your character break (or perhaps a better word  would be “modify”) one of those rules, usually when  your character meets certain conditions.  So, for example, normally when   󲊸   get added to your  dice pool, you roll them with the rest of the pool. If,  however, your character has the Knack for It talent  (page   73 ), when you make certain skill checks, you  can remove up to   󲊸   󲊸   from the pool. You’ve modified  how that rule worked for your character.  Let’s consider another example. Normally, the only way  to disable or destroy an item is to use a weapon with the  Sunder item quality or have your character physically  interact with the item. However, if your character has  the How Convenient! talent (page   80 ), you can make a  check to have the item spontaneously break, without your  character having taken any physical actions to break it!  So now that you have an idea of what you’re going to  be creating, let’s begin.  c reatin G   a   t alent  First, you should have an idea about what your talent is  going to do. Is it going to be a defensive talent—a talent  that protects your character from certain threats? Is it  an offensive talent that allows your character to take  some form of aggressive action against an opponent?  Is it a utility talent that will make a task your charac -  ter wants to perform easier, or is it a debuff talent that  makes an opponent’s task harder?  Once you have a general idea in your mind, ask your -  self the following questions.  D   o   y ou   W   ant   a   m echanical   e ffect   or   a   n arrative   o ne   ?  In our examples in the   What Is a Talent   section, Knack  for It has a mechanical effect: it lets you remove dice  from a dice pool. How Convenient!, on the other hand,  has a narrative effect, because it changes the ongoing  story but doesn’t interact directly with game mechanics.  If you want your talent to have a narrative effect, then  the main part of the talent should describe the narra -  tive effect you want the talent to create. With narra -  tive effects, we recommend providing an example or  two, and also adding in some text that reminds players  that the GM needs to give final approval to any story  changes. You do not want your talent to create a con -  frontation between the player and the GM!  If you want your talent to have a mechanical effect,  then the rest of the questions are going to help define  that effect more.  W   hich   c haracters   D   oes   the   t alent   e ffect   ?  Generally, talents that affect the character who has them  benefit that character in some way (otherwise, why take  the talent?) Talents that affect others are beneficial if they  target allies, and harmful if they target enemies.  D o   y ou   u se   t his   t alent   Durin G   a   s pecific   t ype   of   e ncounter ?  Some talents are designed to be used in combat. Other  talents are supposed to be used in social encounters,  exploration, or other activities. Finally, some talents  can be used in multiple types of encounters.  i s   the   t alent   a ctive   or   p assive   ?  Passive talents create a static, unchanging effect that is  always working, whether the character wants it to or not.  Two of the most common passive talents are Grit (page  73 ) and Toughened (page   75 ), which permanently  increase your character’s strain or wound threshold.  Active talents, on the other hand, require you to  make a conscious choice whether or not to use them.  A talent like Quick Draw (page   74 ), for instance, lets  you choose to have your character draw a weapon or  item more quickly than usual, but they can always pull  out their gun at the regular speed.  i f   the   talent   is   active   ,   ho W   lon G   D oes   it   take   to   use   ?  Active talents usually describe how long it takes to  use them, so that they can be used during structured  encounters. A talent can take an action to use (requiring Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 195  you to spend your character’s one action during their  turn to use it). It could instead require a maneuver to  use (requiring you to spend one of your character’s two  potential maneuvers to use it). It could even require an  incidental to use, which means that your character can  use it at any point during their turn, as long as they fol -  low the directions in the talent.  Some talents are designed to be used during other  characters’ turns instead (see the Dodge talent, on  page   78 ). Talents like this always require an out-of-  turn incidental to use. They can’t require an action or  maneuver, because generally your character can’t take  actions or maneuvers on other characters’ turns!  i f   the   talent   is   active   ,   W hat   D oes   it   cost   to   use   ?  Costs are some sort of resource that you have to invest  for your character to use the talent.  •   Story Points:   Spending a Story Point is a significant  cost for using a talent. This isn’t just because Story  Points are a limited resource shared among all the  players, although that’s a big part of it! You should  also remember that if you spend a Story Point to  activate a talent when making a skill check, you can’t  spend it to upgrade the difficulty or ability of the  check. Thus, a talent that requires spending a Story  Point needs to be better than upgrading a check.  Reserve Story Points for talents that let characters  increase damage on attacks, significantly alter the  ongoing narrative, or reroll skill checks.  •   Strain:   Many talents inflict strain on your charac -  ter when they use them. Strain is a great cost for  a talent, mainly because it’s so adjustable. A talent  can cost as little as 1 strain to use, or as much as 3  or 4. Generally, do not go higher than 4 for a strain  cost, unless the talent is very good. If the cost of  strain is tied to another cost (such as requiring an  action or maneuver to perform), then keep the  strain cost at 1 strain.  •   Time:   The limited number of actions and maneu -  vers your character has available each round is also  a resource, and therefore a cost. Keep in mind that  a talent that requires an action is going to “cost”  more of your character’s resources than a talent  that requires a maneuver or incidental.  h o W   often   shoul D   the   talent   be   use D   D urin G   a   session   ?  Some talents are either very powerful or just slow down  gameplay enough that you don’t want your players using  them constantly. That’s why most talents have use limita -  tions, which is a fancy way of asking, “How frequently do  you want someone to use this talent?”  •   Once per round on the character’s turn:   This is  exactly what it sounds like: the character can use  this talent once per game round (or its equivalent,  if this is a social encounter), and furthermore, can  only use the talent when it’s their turn. Think of this  as your default limiter for active talents. Unless the  way your talent works limits it to being used once a  round anyway, you want to make sure you include  this limitation. Otherwise, you run the risk of creat -  ing rules language that lets your players use the tal -  ent multiple times on the same turn and compound  its effects (possibly to a game-breaking degree).  •   Once per round:   This is a slightly looser variant  of the previous limiter. The character still can only  use the talent once per round, but they can use  it during anyone’s turn, not just their own. If you  use this limiter, make sure of two things. First, it  can only take an out-of-turn incidental to use the  talent (since characters can’t perform actions or  maneuvers on other characters’ turns). Second,  make sure you’re fine with the talent being able to  interrupt other characters’ turns!  •   Once per encounter:   Reserve this for talents that  are a bit more powerful and are going to have an  impact in an encounter. You can further refine this  limitation by adding in “on the character’s turn,”  or leave it so that it can be used at any point dur -  ing an encounter (in which case you need to take  the same considerations that we mentioned in the  “once per round” entry).  •   Once per session:   Reserve this for very powerful  talents, or talents that take a lot of time to resolve in  gameplay. For example, our “reroll a check” talents  are almost always once per session. This is because  the ability to reroll a check that you botch is really  good, but it’s also really time-consuming (you need to  roll the check, review the results, decide that they’re  not good enough, then reroll the check and review  the results a second time). Just like with “once per  encounter” limiters, you’ll need to decide if it only  works on the character’s turn or at any point.  W   hat   tier   D oes   your   talent   occupy   ?  Tiers are the way to price talents. The higher the tier,  the more experience points it takes to buy a talent on  it. Therefore, better talents should occupy higher   tiers,  and vice versa. To help you determine the proper tier  for your talent, we’ve listed each of the five tiers with  examples of what belongs in each.  As you decide what tier to put your talent on, con -  sider that you can put a good talent on a lower tier if you Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 196  increase the resources needed to use it or add some other  limiter. Likewise, you can put a weak talent on a higher  tier if you let characters use it more easily or more often.  t ier   1  Tier 1 talents are usually simple talents with small  effects. Ranked talents that increase your character’s  strain and wound thresholds are Tier 1 talents, as are  talents that increase your character’s ability to heal  wounds or reduce the impact of Critical Injuries they  suffer. None of these are too remarkable if you just pur -  chase them once, but being able to purchase them five  times makes them really useful, if you’re willing to pay  all of that XP.  Most talents that let you remove   󲊸   also belong in  Tier 1. Though these talents are useful, they rely on   󲊸  being in the dice pool in the first place, so they are situ -  ational. Similarly, talents that are good only in certain  situations belong in Tier 1. A talent that lets you add   󲊸  when attacking targets that haven’t acted yet is good,  but it relies on your character going first, and it only  works during the first turn. That limitation makes it a  Tier 1 talent.  Finally, talents with basic action economy belong  in this tier. These include talents that let your charac -  ter stand up or pull out a weapon without spending a  maneuver: useful but situationally dependent.  t ier   2  Tier 2 is where talents start becoming more interesting.  We suggest putting talents on Tier 2 that change how  a character is going to behave throughout an encoun -  ter. Ranked defensive talents go in Tier 2, such as those  that let characters perform maneuvers or actions that  protect them from melee or ranged attacks. Addition -  ally, include talents that give characters more combat  options, such as letting them wield two weapons with -  out a penalty. Tier 2 also includes talents that allow char -  acters to provide minor but useful bonuses to their allies  (such as adding   󲊴   or   󲊸   to certain types of checks).  Overall, Tier 2 is a good place to add in ranked talents  that are useful enough that you want a lot of characters  to take them, but that you do not want to become an  “auto-include.” The step up from Tier 1 means that some  characters will find other talents more useful instead.  t ier   3  Tier 3 is a good place to put talents that can really change  the way the game is played. A character must invest a lot  of experience points to buy a Tier 3 talent, so the payoff  should always feel worth it.  These talents can be more versatile defensive or  offensive talents, such as the ability to upgrade the dif -  ficulty of any combat check that targets your character,  or the ability to add more damage to a combat check.  They can also be more potent buffs for a character’s  allies, such as the ability to give them extra maneuvers,  or improved versions of previous talents.  Put any talent that lets a player reroll a check here, or  a talent that lets a player fundamentally alter an ongo -  ing encounter. You’ll also notice talents on this tier that  let a character gain a permanent “pet” of some sort. Not  only is this a good mechanical bonus, it’s the kind of  talent that a player feels satisfied at finally being able  to acquire.  t ier   4  Tier 4 should be the home of some of your best talents.  Arguably, these talents can be “game-breaking” talents  that deliberately alter the way the game is going to  work for certain characters. For example, a talent that  lets you choose a Critical Injury when your character  inflicts one, rather than rolling randomly, is a pretty  serious change to how the game gets played.  Talents that heavily alter the game’s action economy  should be Tier 4 talents. If a talent lets a character do  something that would normally require an action as a  maneuver, that means they can potentially do it three  times in a single round instead of once. Likewise, a buff  that lets allies perform extra actions belongs here too  (because it slows down gameplay, any talent that lets  a character roll multiple pools of dice in a single turn  should be a Tier 4 talent). Tier 4 should also be home  to some ranked talents that you don’t want players pur -  chasing many ranks of.  t ier   5  Tier 5 should be limited to a few very good talents. In  fact, Tier 5 talents may not be much better than Tier  4 talents, but they’re also talents that should be pur -  chased rarely (maybe even only once) in a character’s  progression. One example is a talent that permanently  improves one of a character’s characteristics. Another  example is a talent that lets a character decrease the dif -  ficulty of certain skill checks with minimal cost. These  both greatly improve a character’s chances of success.  Remember, your game doesn’t need to have a lot of  Tier 5 talents. Since all ranked talents increase their  tier every time you purchase them, they eventually all  become Tier 5 talents.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 197  C reate   an   i te M  A s with the other “create your  own” sections in this part of the  book, this section is less a rule set and  more a set of guidelines. If you’ve read   Part  I–Chapter 5: Equipment , starting on page  82   (if you haven’t, you may want to stop and  read it first), you know all of the basic parts of a  weapon or piece of armor (damage, Critical  rating, soak, defense, etc.), and you know  all of the item qualities and how they work.  If you want, you can just plug any numbers  you fancy into those parts, and create your own  item. What these guidelines do is help you  build items that will not unbalance your game.  There are three types of items you can con -  struct: weapons, armor, and gear. Weapons  and armor are self-explanatory, and gear cov -  ers everything else. Gear items are the simplest  to construct, so we’ll cover them first.  G ear  As discussed on page   93 , many pieces of  gear don’t have any special rules. You simply  need to write a description for what the item does  in the game. For example, a bottle of alcohol just needs  a description explaining its quality (or lack thereof)  and that it will get a character intoxicated if they drink  too much of it. No rules are necessary. All you need is  a roleplaying prompt.  Other pieces of gear are what we call the “right tools  for the job.” These are items that characters need to  perform a particular task (see page   93 ). Like role -  playing prompts, these just need a description of what  they let a character do, and they don’t need any special  rules. For example, a respirator and oxygen tank let a  character survive underwater for long periods of time,  and without them, the character would drown.  When creating these items, you just need to write a  description that says what they let characters do. You  can use modern-day or historical equivalents to help  determine their capabilities and costs.  G ear   W ith   s pecific   r ules  Some gear does come with special in-game mechanical  modifiers. However, since gear can refer to anything that  isn’t a weapon or a piece of armor, guidelines for creating  those mechanical modifiers have to be fairly broad.  •   Most gear should not have mechanical modifiers.  Creating too many pieces of gear with specific, unique  rules is going to overcomplicate your game with a lot  of tedious minutia. Your players aren’t going to want  to remember that drinking a cup of coffee lets them  add a   󲊸   to Vigilance checks for the next 1d5 hours,  for example. (Honestly, you’re not going to want to  keep track of that, either!) Before you create a rule for  a piece of gear, ask yourself: "Does it have a significant  impact on the story or theme?"  •   Make sure the rules interact with existing game  mechanics, and don’t create new ones.   We’re not  suggesting that you can’t create new mechanical  subsystems for your own game, but that a specific  item is usually a bad place to do it. For example,  a poison should interact with the existing wound/  strain threshold system, and not create an entirely  new type of damage that your players have to track.  •   It’s better to reduce penalties than add bonuses.   We  recommend this because reducing penalties means  you also reduce complexity. Removing   󲊸   from a  pool is one good example; it increases the character’s  chance of success while giving them fewer dice to  roll (meaning the dice pool is easier to interpret and  physically easier to handle). Decreasing the difficulty  of checks is another example of this. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 198  e ncumbrance  Encumbrance is discussed on page   84 , but remember  that it’s basically an abstract numeric value that describes  how heavy and bulky something is. When deciding on  an encumbrance value for an item, take a look at that  section and its examples, and use those values as a guide.  a rmor  After gear, the next most complicated item to design is  armor. Armor’s primary characteristics are discussed on  page   92 . When creating a piece of armor, the two you  need to be most concerned about are soak and defense.  s oak  Soak is likely the single most important aspect of a  piece of armor, since it reliably reduces damage. When  you choose a soak value, you should consider a value  between 0 and 3, with 3 being rare, and potentially  coming with some drawback (possibly a high cost or  encumbrance) to balance it out.  Something to keep in mind when choosing a soak  value is that the   Genesys’ s combat system was designed  with the idea that characters who get hit almost always  suffer damage.   Genesys   is a fast-paced and exciting  game; every hit should be a potential threat to a character.  D   efense  Armor is less likely to have defense than soak. This  goes back to the goal of keeping dice pools under con -  trol. Since defense adds   󲊸   directly to the dice pool,  it can contribute to making the dice pool unwieldy if  the defense value is too high. Defense is valued more  highly than soak, which may seem a bit counterintui -  tive. It’s true that soak is more reliable than rolling a  󲊸 , but soak just mitigates damage from successful hits.  Since defense can add   󲊰   to the results, it can stop those  hits from happening entirely (likewise,   󲊱   can stop  Critical Injuries or other effects from triggering). Soak  can also be ignored by item qualities like Pierce and  Breach (see pages   88   and   87 ).  e ncumbrance  You can determine armor’s encumbrance by following  the same guidelines as found in   Chapter 5: Equipment .  However, keep in mind the rule from page   92 ; the  encumbrance value of a piece of armor lowers by three  when the armor is worn. Basically, it’s a lot easier to wear  a heavy coat than it is to carry it. We recommend giving  armor an encumbrance value between 2 and 5, with 5  being reserved for armor with a lot of soak.  s pecific   r ules   an D   i tem   Q   ualities  Generally, armor has fewer special rules than gear does.  Since armor has a lot more mechanical functions already,  special rules are less necessary to make it interesting in  your game. If you want to design a special rule, consider  something like the stealth penalties found on the fantasy  armor on page   145 , or perhaps a boost to Coercion checks  for frightening armor sets. These rules define something  about the character and their actions while wearing the  armor. When you design those special rules, use the same  guidelines talked about on page   197   for gear.  Also note that there are a few item qualities (see page  86 ) that work with armor (although most of them  are designed for weapons). The Reinforced quality is  one obvious choice for armor. It makes armor really  good, however, so reserve it for a few rare sets of armor.  c ost   an D   r arity  Calculating the cost for a set of armor is largely a matter of  guesswork and reasonable estimation. However, we have  included   Table III.1–1: Armor Cost Calculations , which  provides some values you can use to calculate the cost for  your new item (starting from a cost of 0). Use the values  as a baseline, but don’t be afraid to change them. Rarity  should be up to how common the item is in your setting.  TABLE III.1–1: ARMOR COST CALCULATIONS  Derived Attribute   Additional Cost  +1 Defense   50  +2 Defense   500  +3 Defense   2,000  +4 Defense   5,000  +1 Soak   50  +2 Soak   500  +3 Soak   1,000  +4 Soak   2,500  –1 Encumbrance   75  –2 Encumbrance   250  –3 Encumbrance   500  The Reinforced Quality   3,000  Other Positive Qualities   50  Other Negative Qualities   –50  Combining low soak with low defense: increase cost by 100–250.  Combining low value with higher value: increase cost by 250–500.  Combining high value with high value: increase cost by 1,000–2,000. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 199  W eapons  Weapons are the most complicated items to design,  since they have the most attributes.  First, decide whether your weapon is going to be a  melee weapon (such as a knife or club), or a ranged  weapon (such as a bow or gun). Your choice is going to  determine some of those characteristics.  G   eneral   a ttributes  Unsurprisingly, ranged and melee weapons share a lot of  the same attributes. So first, we’ll discuss the attributes  that both weapons share. Then, we’ll discuss those that  are specific to melee weapons, and then ranged weapons.  c ritical   r atin G  When choosing a Crit rating for your weapon, con -  sider how lethal you want the weapon to be. Crit rat -  ings range from 1 to 6. Values of 1 or 6 are very rare,  since checks generate   󲊴   really often and almost never  generate   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴 . The “average” Crit rating is  3. This should probably be the default for your weapon,  as it makes Critical Injuries rare enough to be an event,  but still common enough to happen a couple of times  per encounter. A Crit rating of 2 should be applied to  a more deadly weapon. Likewise, a Crit rating of 4 is a  weapon that is going to inflict lasting or immediately  lethal injuries less often. A Crit rating of 5 or higher  means the weapon is almost never going to inflict a  Critical Injury without spending   󲊵 .  e ncumbrance  When setting the encumbrance value of a weapon,  consider the skill being used to wield it. Brawl weap -  ons should have an encumbrance of 1. Melee (Light)  weapons and Ranged (Light) weapons should have an  encumbrance of 1, maybe 2. Melee (Heavy) and Ranged  (Heavy) weapons should have an encumbrance of 3 or  4. Gunnery weapons can have a lot of encumbrance,  as much as 8 or 9. This may be too much for one per -  son to wield, but then again, most people can’t carry a  heavy machine gun around the battlefield in real life,  either! Most of these weapons need bipods or slings to  help offset their heavy weight and bulkiness, and the  optional attachment rules cover this (see page   206 ).  c ost   an D   r arity  As with armor,   Table III.1–2: Weapon Cost Calcula -  tions   does not give you a perfect means of calculating  cost. All we intend for it to do is give you a starting  point from which you can modify as needed. Costs  should start at 0. Rarity, of course, is entirely up to you.  s pecial   r ules   an D   i tem   Q   ualities  Most of the item qualities listed on page   86   work with  weapons, so you have quite a few qualities to choose  from! When choosing qualities for your weapon, think  through the interactions of the various qualities. For  example, don’t give a weapon Pierce and Breach, since  they both do the same thing.  b ase   d a M age  Remember that when you set the damage for  a weapon, it's only the base damage. When a  character uses the weapon, they add additional  damage based on the number of   󲊳   their check  generates. You should think of your weapon as  dealing 1 to 2 more damage than the listed dam -  age, on average.  TABLE III.1–2: WEAPON COST CALCULATIONS  Characteristic   Additional Cost  4–5 Damage   100  6–7 Damage   250  8–9 Damage   500  10–12 Damage   1,000  13+ Damage   3,000  Crit Rating 5–6   0  Crit Rating 4   50  Crit Rating 3   150  Crit Rating 2   300  Crit Rating 1   600  Short Range   0  Medium Range   100  Long Range   300  Extreme Range   600  Cumbersome and Unwieldy Qualities   –100 per rank beyond 1  Burn, Ensnare, and Linked Qualities   200 per rank  Defensive and Deflection   Use defense costs in   Table III.1–1  Disorient, Accurate, and Stun Qualities   50 per rank  Concussive Quality   1,000 per rank  Other Positive Qualities   100 per rank (or 250)  Other Negative Qualities   –75 per rank (or –100)  Melee or Brawl weapons   reduce cost to 50% of total Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 200  Overall, you probably want to limit the number of  item qualities you give a weapon to three or four at max -  imum, and don’t be afraid to only give it one (or even  none). Qualities are meant to add extra interest or utility  to a weapon, and sometimes to represent certain unique  aspects of its use (for example, a net gun would need to  have the Ensnare quality). However, give a weapon too  many qualities, and it becomes hard to interpret exactly  what that weapon does when you’re playing.  Most qualities have a rating associated with them. This  rating is a numeric value, and it defines some aspect of  the item quality. Deciding what number to give a quality  can be tricky, so we have some suggestions.  Burn,   Concussive,   Disorient, and   Ensnare:   These  qualities all have ratings that affect the duration of their  effect. The higher the rating, the more rounds the effect  lasts. Disorient is fairly mild, so you can give it higher  ratings of 4 or even 5. You don’t want to give it a rating  of 1, because that’s no different than spending   󲊴   󲊴   to  add   󲊸   to your target’s next check. Burn and Ensnare are  more potent. Generally, these should have ratings of 1 to  3, with 4 only very rarely. Concussive is extremely potent  and should only be given a rating of 1 or possibly 2.  Cumbersome and   Unwieldy:   Since these qualities  require your character to have certain characteristics  or suffer penalties, you should use them to balance  out powerful weapons by adding drawbacks. If you  use these qualities, just make sure you don’t give them  a rating of 1. Since the rating is the minimum Brawn  or Agility the wielder needs to have, and all species or  archetypes start with a minimum of 1 in every charac -  teristic, a rating of 1 does nothing.  Accurate,   Inaccurate,   Defensive, and   Deflection:   Since  these are qualities that add dice to checks, keep the ratings  at 1 or 2, to avoid excessive bloat in your dice pools. Also,  remember Inaccurate is a penalty, and should be added  to balance weapons that are otherwise cheap or powerful.  Pierce and   Breach:   Although   Pierce and Breach both let  you ignore soak, Breach is ten times as effective. Really,  Breach is intended to mostly be used with the optional  vehicle rules (page   220 ), so unless you’re making a  weapon that ignores soak, don’t bother with this quality.  With Pierce, just keep in mind that until you get to  ratings of 5 or higher, you can think of your Pierce  rating as the equivalent of adding damage to checks.  Pierce has diminishing returns after the value exceeds  average soak values, so price weapons accordingly.  Prepare and   Slow-Firing:   Both of these qualities rep -  resent the extra time it takes to use a weapon, so they  should have low ratings of 1 or 2. Waiting three rounds  before using something (or having to spend more than a  turn’s worth of maneuvers preparing to use something)  makes it nearly worthless in most players’ eyes.  Blast:   When selecting a Blast rating, use the same  guidelines you use to determine the base damage for  weapons. Blast can have a slightly lower damage than  the weapon’s base damage, though.  Guided:   Guided allows projectiles to “track” and make  follow-up attacks if they miss the target. We recom -  mend a rating of 2 to 4 for Guided. A rating of 1 means  the projectile will almost never hit, while a rating of 5 is  probably better than the initial attack!  Limited Ammo:   If you’re dealing with a thrown weapon  such as a grenade or throwing knife, it should have a  Limited Ammo rating of 1 (representing that you can  only use it once). Otherwise, you can go with whatever  rating makes sense for the weapon.  However, remember that combat encounters gen -  erally only last four or five rounds, so if your Limited  Ammo rating is higher than that, running out of ammo  won’t come into play. So, unless each shot costs money,  don’t give weapons high Limited Ammo ratings.  Linked:   Since we used Linked to represent weapons that  fire multiple barrels at once, choose a value that best rep -  resents the number of shots this weapon can make in a  round (counting the number of barrels if you need to).  Just remember, the Linked rating determines   additional  hits. If you have a weapon with four barrels, you would  give it Linked 3. The weapon can score one initial hit,  and three additional hits, for a total of four.  Stun:   Keep this quality’s rating at 1 to 4. Any more,  and you could potentially incapacitate your target in  one hit, which we want to avoid.  Vicious:   Vicious amplifies the effect of Critical Injuries.  Since Critical Injuries are the only way characters can  be killed, Vicious makes weapons especially deadly.  Any rating of Vicious is powerful (so don’t apply this to  too many weapons), but don’t give a weapon a Vicious rat -  ing of 6 or higher. Adding +60 to a Critical Injury result  means that the right roll can permanently kill a completely  uninjured character, which breaks the spirit of the game.  m elee   (   an D   b ra W l   ) W   eapons  A melee weapon is anything your character uses to attack  someone right in front of them. Examples include swords,  clubs, brass knuckles, tasers, and laser blades. This section  discusses the attributes unique to these weapons.  s kill  The skill listed for the weapon is the skill your character  uses when fighting with it. Here’s a list of the applicable  skills for close combat weapons. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 201  •   Brawl:   Although Brawl generally covers unarmed  fighting, there are some weapons that use the Brawl  skill. These include brass knuckles,   cestuses ,   tekkös ,  and anything else designed to make you hit harder or  do something unpleasant when you punch someone.  •   Melee (Light):   Melee (Light) is a variant of the  Melee skill that covers using one-handed close  combat weapons, including swords, knives, clubs,  katanas, light spears, shock prods, and even shields.  •   Melee (Heavy):   Melee (Heavy) is the other variant  of the Melee skill. This covers large, two-handed  close combat weapons including greatswords, laser  spears, mauls, pikes, halberds, and greataxes.  When deciding what skill to use with the weapon,  just pick the description that best fits, keeping in mind  which skills exist in your setting.  D   ama G e  The guidelines for damage for ranged weapons apply  for close combat weapons, with one important excep -  tion. Most close combat weapons have a “+” in front of  their damage rating, which means characters add their  Brawn to the damage rating to determine the weapon’s  base damage. When you’re determining damage rating,  mentally add three to the value you’re considering to  determine actual damage (most melee-focused charac -  ters have a Brawn of at least 3).  One-handed close combat weapons (Brawl or Melee  [Light]) have a damage rating of +1 to +3, while two-  handed close combat weapons (Melee [Heavy]) have a  damage rating of +3 to +5. Close combat weapons tend  to have slightly lower damage ratings than ranged weap -  ons. Players can improve the damage simply by increasing  their characters’ Brawn, so with less control over the total  damage rating, it’s better to err on the side of caution.  r an G e  Close combat weapons almost universally have a range  of engaged, for obvious reasons.  r an G e D   W   eapons  Ranged weapons are anything your character can use to  attack someone at a distance. Examples include bows,  slings, pistols, rifles, and futuristic lasers and railguns.  s kill  The skill listed on the weapon is the skill your character  uses when fighting with it. There are quite a few combat  skills (most of them specific to certain settings):  •   Ranged (Light):   Ranged (Light) is a variant of the  Ranged skill that covers any one-handed ranged  weapons. Generally these are pistols, but Ranged  (Light) could also encompass grenades, throwing  knives,   shuriken , and darts.  •   Ranged (Heavy):   Ranged (Heavy) is a variant  of the Ranged skill that covers any two-handed  ranged weapons. Generally these are rifles, but  Ranged   (Heavy)   could   also   encompass   bows,  crossbows, shotguns, and automatic weapons.  •   Gunnery:   Gunnery is a skill that specifically covers  the heaviest ranged weaponry, often weapons that are  mounted on vehicles. It can also include large “hand-  held” weapons such as rocket launchers, catapults,  machine guns, swivel guns, laser cannons, and so-  forth. Basically, if the weapon belongs on a vehicle, is  used to destroy vehicles, or needs a tripod or bipod to  shoot, it’s probably a Gunnery weapon.  When deciding what skill to use with the weapon,  just pick the description that best fits.  D   ama G e  When you set damage for your weapon, it looks like  you have a wide range of options to choose from. How -  ever, weapon damage should fall into the specific range  of 4 to 15, with 4 being damage for the weakest weap -  ons, and 15 being for the heaviest weapons that a per -  son can carry into battle. That range is set to interact  with the character’s soak value, which should usually  be between 2 and 6, with 4 being the most common.  Finally, we recommend limiting weapons that use a  particular combat skill to certain amounts of damage.  Basically, Ranged (Light) weapons do less damage than  Ranged (Heavy) weapons, and Gunnery weapons do  the most damage. These distinctions help separate dif -  ferent types and classes of weapons.  Generally, Ranged (Light) weapons deal 4 to 7 dam -  age, Ranged (Heavy) weapons deal 8 to 12 damage, and  Gunnery weapons deal 13+ damage. Feel free to adjust  these values, especially when dealing with weapons  that don’t quite fit the mold, such as grenades.  r an G e  Ranged weapons should all have a maximum range of  short range or higher. Generally, most Ranged (Light)  weapons should be short or medium range (and any  thrown weapons such as knives or grenades should be  short range). Ranged (Heavy) weapons are more likely  to be medium or long range, although a sniper rifle or  its equivalent might be able to attack at extreme range.  Gunnery weapons should almost always be medium,  long, or extreme ranged weapons (a grenade launcher  or ballista might be medium range, while a guided mis -  sile or trebuchet might be long range).

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 202  C reate   an   a dversary  T here is no single “right” way to create   adversaries for  your   Genesys   game. The process depends not only  on your personal preferences, but on the needs of your  game and the part the adversary will play. Therefore,  this section provides guidance on creating an adversary  instead of detailing a step-by-step process. You’ll likely  adapt our guidance to create your own process as you  become more familiar with our game.  D evelop   a   c oncept  Coming up with a concept for an adversary is the  obvious starting point, just as with any other NPC,  or PC, for that matter. You probably already have an  idea of what kind of adversary you want, whether it’s a  depraved cultist, aquatic predator, or whatever else you  have planned for your adventure. However, sometimes  you might simply want to include an adversary to chal -  lenge the PCs in a particular type of encounter. If that’s  the case, take a few moments to think about your other  plans for the adventure. Your overall plans will prob -  ably suggest what form this adversary should take.  c hoose   a D versary   t ype  We have three categories of adversaries in   Genesys : min -  ion, rival, and nemesis. These types, and the differences  between them, are described on page   131 . Although you  might decide on an adversary’s type after building its pro -  file, most of the time you’ll decide on a type based on the  part you expect it to play in the adventure.  Most of the time, your original concept is going to  suggest the appropriate adversary type. A group of  outlaws intended to harass your PCs during a journey  are probably just minions, while their leader may be a  rival. Nemeses are the rarest type and are almost always  highly defined NPCs with a name, strong motivations,  and a big part to play in the ongoing story.  b uil D in G   the   p rofile  Once you have a concept for the adversary, you can  start the actual process of “building” the adversary  profile. As we’ve previously stated, adversaries are not  confined by the rules for player character creation and  progression. This is especially important to remember  when designing your own adversaries.  Designing an adversary’s profile is simpler than you  might think. As a guiding principle, always remember  that adversaries exist to interact with your players' char -  acters, and they’re only ever going to see a few aspects  of the adversary, so keep things simple! Only include  skills you think your adversary will use, and add one or  two significant talents and abilities that will make a big  impact in an encounter instead of a lot of minor abili -  ties that probably won’t come up. An adversary is not a  player character, so don’t treat them like one.  n ame   an D   D   escription  A good name is important for any NPC, since that’s what  your players will remember. The rest of the description  can be a few bullet points or notes to record the adver -  sary’s most memorable attributes and personality quirks.  c haracteristics  When assigning characteristics, remember that your  goal should be to challenge the player characters, but  not defeat them. So, most adversaries should have a  few strong characteristics, a few average characteristics,  and at least one weak characteristic.  When creating minions, you can assign characteristics  of 2 (human average) in areas you want them to be pro -  ficient in, and of 1 in areas you want them to be weak  in. Minions work best in groups, so they’ll be relying on  their numbers to be dangerous. A powerful minion can  have one or two characteristics of 3, but not higher.  Rivals work alone, so you should give them character -  istics of 3 in the areas you expect them to be proficient in  (a combat-focused rival should have Brawn 3 or Agility  3, for example), the rest of their characteristics being a 2  or 1. Nemeses follow these guidelines as well, but they  can have slightly higher overall characteristics than rivals.  Monsters and creatures can have even higher character -  istics to represent their inhuman nature. Remember  that we try to limit characteristic values to 5; however,  you might decide a characteristic of 6 is necessary for an  inhumanly potent foe. Do this rarely, and your players are  sure to be impressed when you assemble the dice pool!  t hreshol D s   an D   s oak   /D   efense  Thresholds represent an adversary’s ability to suffer  physical and mental injury, stress, and other punishment  and keep on going. Although there is no set formula for  determining thresholds, we do have some guidelines.  Minions should generally have wound thresholds of  3 to 5, never higher than 7. Rivals should have wound  thresholds between 10 and 15 (unless the rival is a crea -  ture or monster, in which case you can go as high as 20 to  25). Nemeses can have wound thresholds of 10 to 20 (with  giant creatures and monsters being potentially higher). Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Nemeses also get strain thresholds. These should usually  be lower than wound thresholds, probably in the 10 to  15 range. Also, consider giving a nemesis with a higher  wound threshold a lower strain threshold, and vice versa.  When selecting a soak and defense for your adversary,  you can use their Brawn characteristic and armor as a  starting point, then increase as needed. Just remember  that a defense of 2 and soak of 4 or 5 is good, and a defense  of 3 or soak of 6 or 7 is very hard to overcome.  s kills  Most adversaries really only need a few skills that reflect  their areas of expertise. Keep in mind that a character  can attempt a skill check even without any ranks in  the skill, so a high characteristic can be just as good in  some cases. When deciding which skills to include in an  adversary profile, think not only about your adversary  concept, but also about the part you expect it to play in  the game. An adversary intended to pose a combat chal -  lenge only needs combat skills, while one planned for  a social encounter might not need combat skills at all.  Also, when designing a combat-focused adversary, only  give it the combat skills it needs to use its weapons.  An adversary’s type also affects its skills. Minions,  of course, don’t possess ranks in skills, but they can  have skills that they gain as a minion group. Minions  are throw-away opponents and only need two or three  skills. Rivals and nemeses can have more, but keep in  mind our advice about keeping things simple.  t alents  It can be tempting to load an adversary up with tal -  ents, but keep your focus on usability during the game.  Choose talents that are important, likely to come up, and  do something interesting. Remember that there is no  need to include talents that directly modify other parts  of the profile, like Grit or Toughened—you can just  modify those values directly.  We   recommend   that   minions  never   have   talents.   A   rival  doesn’t have to have any tal -  ents, but could have one (or  two, but only in rare instances).  A nemesis may have more, but  three is plenty! In all cases, go  with fewer, more potent talents over  a lot of minor talents. And of course, adver -  saries don’t have to follow the tier system  or other restrictions, so just give them the  talents that make the most sense. Finally,  instead of giving adversaries lots of defen -  sive talents, just give them the Adversary  talent on page   131 . Rivals should only  have one rank at maximum, and nem -  eses shouldn't have more than three.  a bilities  Abilities are special rules for an adversary that allow  them to do things talents and skills don’t, which means  that these are things they can do that PCs can’t. There  are few limits on the possibilities, and coming up with  unique new abilities can be the most fun part of creat -  ing an adversary. Just keep these principles in mind.  First, follow the same guidelines as with talents. Make  sure your abilities are few in number and impactful in  the game. Take a look at the abilities of the adversaries  in this book. This can help you get an idea of what works  well as an ability, and you also might find an existing  ability that works perfectly for your new adversary.  When designing a new ability, avoid unnecessary  complication. Abilities should work within the existing  structure of the rules. Don’t design a new damage type  when your spider’s venom can just inflict strain, and  don’t invent new gliding rules when the flying rules  work just as well in nearly every situation.  e Q uipment  There are no special rules to follow when equipping  adversaries. We just recommend limiting your adver -  sary to one or two weapons (perhaps a ranged and melee  weapon) and one piece of armor (or none if your adver -  sary wouldn’t wear any). Other equipment can be han -  dled narratively. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 204  CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATE RULES  A lternate rules are rules that we think could be use -  ful to some of your games, but not every game.  Some of these rules are just extra game systems that  could be tacked onto most settings, but aren’t needed  in any of them. Magic is a good example of this. You  can have magic (as actual “magic” or reskinned as psy -  chic powers or some vaguely more scientific variant)  in pretty much any setting. But any setting can work  without it, even the weird war and fantasy settings.  Other alternate rules are rules that change how the  game plays. These are rules like unlinking skills and  characteristics (so you can use whichever characteristic  makes the most sense for the situation at hand when  making a skill check). These alternate rules have a fun -  damentally game-altering nature. You and your groups  are probably going to have to make adaptations on the  fly to make sure these rules don’t have negative effects  on your game.  Luckily, that’s why these rules are alternate. You don’t  have to use any of them. Since implementing these  rules could have unforeseen consequences, we do our  best to address potential issues in each rules entry. That  way, you can make an informed decision about using  the rules and plan ahead to address any problems.  n e M esis   e xtra   a C tivation   r ules  A lthough nemeses are supposed to be a challenge  for an entire player group, it doesn’t always work  out that way. In practice, when one character faces off  against an entire group of characters, the group nearly  always wins, and does so quickly. This is because of  the group’s activation advantage: the extra number  of turns they get to take each round because of their  greater numbers. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 205  More turns means more actions, which means more  attacks. Even if a nemesis can reliably eliminate a  player character every round, they are going to be on  the receiving end of three or four additional attacks  from the rest of the group. Characters in   Genesys ,  even nemeses, aren’t designed to withstand that kind of  punishment for more than a couple of rounds.  To make a lone nemesis into more of a challenge for  a group of PCs, you can use the extra activation rule.  e xtra   a ctivation   r ule  When rolling for Initiative for a nemesis-level adver -  sary, roll twice, recording both results. These both  become NPC Initiative slots.  Your nemesis may take two turns during a single  round. Any abilities that last “until the end of their fol -  lowing turn” last until the end of their first turn on the  subsequent round.  t he   e ffects   ,   both   G   oo D   an D   b a D  Your nemesis is going to be more of a threat, because  they’re going to make more attacks and probably inca -  pacitate more of your PCs faster. All of this is great if  you’re looking to make a nemesis feel like a worthy  challenge. However, if you’re not careful, the danger  level of the encounter could change from “challenging”  to “total party kill.” Some nemeses also have powerful  attacks that are balanced by the fact that they can only  make one powerful attack per round.  We recommend you review the nemesis profile  carefully before you use this rule. We also recom -  mend that you only use this with nemeses that con -  front your PCs alone, as in without other NPC allies  to fight alongside them. Finally, you should probably  let your players know that you’re going to use this rule  at the beginning of the encounter, just so they won’t  feel blindsided.  u n C oupling   s kills   fro M   C hara C teristi C s  I n   Genesys , whenever you or your players make a  skill check, the skill determines what characteristic  you use to set the dice pool. This alternate rule throws  out that link. Instead, whenever you make a skill check,  you choose which characteristic to use with the skill.  Your choice needs to make sense in the game, so  it depends on the approach a character is taking to  accomplish the task at hand. When a player chooses  what characteristic to use, they should briefly explain  to their fellow players why this characteristic makes the  most sense to use. If you, the GM, feel the explanation  doesn’t make sense, you can reject it and require them  to choose a different characteristic (or determine the  characteristic for them).  t he   e ffects   ,   both   G   oo D   an D   b a D  The good part about this rule is it lets you and your group  be more creative with roleplaying, and go with whatever  makes the most narrative sense at the time. It can lead to  a richer game with more potential for storytelling.  However,   the   current   skill/characteristic   pairings  make it very hard for a character to be good at every -  thing. This was done so that no one character can domi -  nate a game session and everyone gets their own chance  in the spotlight. Decoupling skills and characteristics  makes it easier for everyone to be better at everything  while spending much less XP. All your character needs is  one high characteristic and a good justification for why  that characteristic should be used in a given situation.  This rule can lead to players spending all of their XP  to maximize one characteristic, then trying to justify  using that characteristic on all of their skill checks. You  may end up with a lot of arguing at your gaming table!  For these reasons, here is a variant of this rule: Keep the  link between skills and characteristics, but let players  use a different characteristic for a specific skill check  if they first spend a Story Point. The additional cost  should keep this rule from being abused. EXAMPLE: DECOUPLING SKILLS  Huck and Mercedes are both interrogating a sus -  pect in police custody, using Coercion. Normally,  Coercion is linked to Willpower. However, Huck  says he’ll offer the suspect a cup of coffee and chat  them up to get more information out of them. He  proposes using Presence with Coercion. Mercedes,  on the other hand, chooses to rough the suspect up.  Since her character is physically attacking the sus -  pect, she proposes using Brawn with Coercion. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 206  i te M   a tta C h M ents   and   h ard   p oints  I tem customization: done correctly, it can be a great  way to expand item options and let your play -  ers add some extra customization to their characters.  Of course, if you do it wrong, you can easily become  bogged down in tedious minutia.  Either way, however, it’s something a lot of us enjoy  exploring. Although the item customization rules aren’t  a part of the core rules of   Genesys , they are an alter -  nate rule set. The rules incorporate two concepts: hard  points that represent the amount of “space” an item has  for customization, and attachments, which are what  fills those hard points.  h ar D   p oints  When customizing an item, there are only so many  improvements you can add. A rifle can’t have ten scopes,  and if you try to give a sword a spiked hilt, saw-toothed  edges, an electrified blade, and a compass in the pom -  mel, you’re probably going to end up with an unwieldy  monstrosity! In   Genesys , hard points determine how  many attachments an item can reasonably hold.  Each item has a certain number of hard points.  Since an item’s hard points aren’t listed in its item  profile, here is a simple system for determining how  many hard points each item possesses.  D   eterminin G   h ar D   p oints  If you’re using the item customization rules, then  each item has a number of hard points equal to half  of its encumbrance value, rounded up. Items with an  encumbrance of 1 or 2 have 1 hard point, items with  an encumbrance of 3 or 4 have 2, items with 5 or 6  have 3, and so forth. When calculating the number of  hard points, use the item’s base encumbrance, before  any modifiers (this is important, because some attach -  ments can decrease an item’s encumbrance and make  it easier to carry).  a ttachments  Attachments are physical components that can attach  to (or are installed) in items to improve their perfor -  mance or add capabilities. Each attachment requires a  certain number of empty hard points in order to install  it. Once you’ve installed an attachment on an item, it  now occupies those hard points, and they’re no longer  considered empty.  i nstallin G   a ttachments  Installing an attachment requires roughly an hour of  work. In addition, the character doing the installing  needs to make a successful   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Mechan -  ics check . Failure simply means that the attachment  isn’t installed, and the character needs to try again.  Failure with a   󲊲   (not likely unless you upgrade the  check’s difficulty) means that the character clumsily  destroys the attachment in the process! Success with  󲊲   means that the installation is successful, but the  attachment may fall off or stop working at an awk -  ward time (which is what happens when you duct  tape a flashlight to an assault rifle).  a ttachment   b reak D o W n  Each attachment entry has set information associated  with the entry.  •   Description:   This explains what the attachment is,  and what settings it is most likely to make sense in.  •   Use With:   This explains what kinds of items you  can put this attachment on.  •   Modifiers:   This explains what the attachment does  within the mechanics of the game system.  •   Hard Points Required:   This is how many hard  points you need empty to add this attachment to  the item.  The price and rarity for the attachments are listed in  Table III.2–1: Weapon Attachments   on the next page  and   Table III.2–2: Armor Attachments   on page   208 .  w hat   about   g ear ?  These rules primarily cover weapon and armor  customization, but not customizing other types  of gear. This is mostly a matter of resources.  Gear covers such a wide category of items that  you could spend a whole book creating differ -  ent attachments that could end up on different  everyday items. Also, since most roleplaying  games tend to focus a bit more on combat, you’re  probably going to care more about customizing  your favorite sword than your favorite canteen. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 207  W eapon   a ttachments  To go with these rules, we’ve included a list of basic weapon  attachments designed to be as broad as possible. However,  most attachments are still only going to work with certain  weapons, and only make sense in certain settings.  b alance D   h ilt  This attachment represents modifying a melee weapon’s  balance (particularly around the hilt or haft) to make it  easier to control. This kind of attachment makes sense  for any setting (even futuristic combat knives can ben -  efit from being finely weighted or balanced).  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any weap -  ons that use the Melee (Light) skill and to one-handed  weapons that use the Melee skill.  Modifiers:   The weapon gains the Accurate 1 quality,  or increases any existing Accurate quality by 1. (If the  weapon has the Inaccurate quality, it reduces that qual -  ity’s rating by 1 to a minimum of 0, instead.)  Hard Points Required:   1.  b ipo D   m ount  A bipod (a folding, two-legged stand) can be attached  to the barrel of a firearm. The legs stabilize the firearm  and take up some of its weight. This kind of attachment  makes sense for the   weird war ,   modern day ,   science  fiction , and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any  Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery weapon.  Modifiers:   If the user spends one preparation maneu -  ver to deploy the bipod, the weapon’s Cumbersome or  Unwieldy qualities are reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0,  and the weapon’s encumbrance is reduced by 2, to a mini -  mum of 0, while the user fires from a crouched or prone  position (or can brace the bipod against something solid).  Hard Points Required:   1.  D   uelist   c ross   G   uar D  This attachment represents modifying the cross guard  of a sword to better catch and lock the blade of an  opponent. This kind of attachment makes sense for the  fantasy   setting, but could make sense for any setting  where dueling with swords is common.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any sword,  whether one-handed or two-handed.  Modifiers:   When an opponent resolves a melee combat  check against the wielder, if the check generated at least  one uncanceled   󲊱 , the wielder may suffer 1 strain as  an out-of-turn incidental to add   󲊱   󲊱   to the results.  Hard Points Required:   1.  e xten D e D   b arrel  This attachment extends the barrel (or makes similar  modifications) to make the weapon fire farther. This  kind of attachment makes sense for the   weird war ,   mod -  ern day ,   science fiction , and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any Ranged  (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery weapons (you may  exclude weapons such as grenades, or weapons that fire  self-propelled ammo such as missile launchers).  Modifiers:   The weapon’s range increases by one range  band, to a maximum of extreme range. The weapon  gains the Cumbersome 2 quality, or increases its exist -  ing Cumbersome quality by 2.  Hard Points Required:   2.  h air   t ri GG er  A “hair trigger” represents a modification that allows  the user to fire a weapon very quickly, although this can  be at the expense of accuracy. This kind of attachment  makes sense for the   weird war ,   modern day ,   science  fiction , and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any pistol.  Modifiers:   When the user makes the first combat  check with this weapon in an encounter, add   󲊳   󲊱   to  the results.  Hard Points Required:   1.

This kind of  attachment makes sense for any setting.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any close  combat weapon that has a blade.  Modifiers:   The weapon gains the Pierce 2 quality, or  increases any existing Pierce quality by 1. The weapon  also decreases its Crit rating by 1, to a minimum of 1.  Hard Points Required:   1.  r ecurve   l imbs  Making the limbs of a bow or crossbow curve away  from the wielder increases the penetrating power of  the bow’s shots, even if it also makes the bow larger and  more difficult to wield. This kind of attachment makes  sense for   fantasy   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any bow  or crossbow.  Modifiers:   The weapon gains the Pierce 2 quality, or  increases any existing Pierce quality by 1. The weapon  also gains the Unwieldy 2 quality, or increases any  existing Unwieldy quality by 1.

Hard Points Required:   1.  t elescopic   s i G ht  A telescopic sight magnifies a target, allowing the user  to shoot targets that they could normally barely be able  to see (futuristic versions may use special enhanced  optics, rather than simple lenses). This kind of attach -  ment makes sense for the   weird war ,   modern day ,   sci -  ence fiction , and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any  ranged weapon that could logically benefit from the  addition of a telescopic sight.  Modifiers:   The user reduces the difficulty of ranged  combat checks made with this weapon at long and  extreme range by 1.  Hard Points Required:   1.  t ripo D   m ount  Like a bipod, the tripod mount is a set of three folding  legs that deploy from the center of the weapon to pro -  vide a stable stand to fire from. This kind of attachment  makes sense for the   weird war ,   modern day ,   science  fiction , and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any  Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery weapon with an encum -  brance of 4 or more.  Modifiers:   If the user spends two preparation maneu -  vers to deploy the tripod, the weapon’s Cumbersome or  Unwieldy qualities are reduced by 3, to a minimum of  0, and the weapon’s encumbrance is reduced by 4, to a  minimum of 0. The weapon may not be moved (except  to pivot on the tripod mount) once it has been set up.  The user must spend two preparation maneuvers to  take the tripod down.  Hard Points Required:   2.  u n D er   - b arrel   W   eapon   a ttachment  Modern firearms sometimes have secondary weapons  attached under the barrel, allowing the wielder to effec -  tively carry two weapons in one. This kind of attach -  ment makes sense for the   modern day ,   science fiction ,  and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any rifle-  sized Ranged (Heavy) weapons.  Modifiers:   When installed, the user chooses one of the  following secondary weapons.

Again, these are designed to  be as broad as possible, but some only make sense in  certain settings.  D   eflective   p latin G  This attachment applies angled plates or mildly reflec -  tive surfaces to help deflect incoming ranged attacks.  This kind of attachment makes sense in   fantasy ,   sci -  ence fiction , and   space opera   settings (in the past,  armor might be designed to deflect arrows or throw -  ing knives, while in the future, it could reflect lasers  or energy blasts).

This kind of attachment makes  sense in   science fiction   and   space opera   settings.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any armor  composed of a hardened carapace.  Modifiers:   When wearing this armor, the user increases  their encumbrance threshold by 5. The user reduces the  rating of the Cumbersome quality of any carried weap -  ons by 1, to a minimum of 1.  Hard Points Required:   2.  i ntimi D atin G   v isa G e  Warriors from many cultures paint their armor or add  imposing face masks to intimidate opponents.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 210  M agi C   r ules  M agic permeates the world of many fantasy settings,  though the ability to harness its power remains  beyond the grasp of most mortals. Of course, both PCs  and their enemies tend to be a cut above, so magic is  likely to feature prominently in your fantasy game.  We’ve described several magic skills already (Arcana,  Divine, and Primal, on page   70 ), and as a GM, you  may use some combination of these skills or create  entirely new magic skills unique to your campaign.  Regardless, magic skills have certain commonalities that  require some additional rules, much like combat skills.  For the sake of convenience, we might sometimes  refer to actions using magic skill checks as spells,  regardless of the source of the magic. Within the cam -  paign world, it can add a lot of flavor if you use various  terms to differentiate kinds of magic, especially when it  comes to in-game dialogue. F or instance, priests using  the Divine skill might perform miracles, while druids  may summon animal allies, and wizards may use the  Arcana skill to fling bolts of fire at their foes.  s pellcasters  Spellcasters, or individuals who can use magic, are any -  one who has at least one rank in a magic skill.   If your  character does not have at least one rank in a magic  skill, they cannot attempt to use magic.   This includes  performing any of the magic actions and maneuvers  listed later in this section.  All   spellcasters, no matter what type of magic they  use, also need to have a certain amount of knowledge  concerning magic and its possibilities. For this rea -  son, your character is going to benefit greatly from  having a couple of ranks in the Knowledge skill if they  want to be a spellcaster.  u sin G   m a G ic   in   n arrative   e ncounters  Magic checks are fundamentally handled like any  other skill check, and called for in the same circum -  stances. As with any other skill, you should generally  only require a check when there are dramatic results or  consequences for failure. For instance, a character who  regularly manifests fire-based effects using their magic  skill shouldn’t need a check to magically light a torch or  campfire. Similarly, a priest who has shown themself to  be a master of the healing arts shouldn’t need a check to  ease the pain of a dying NPC.  With magic skills being so open ended, judging and  resolving magic skill checks may seem challenging, but  it really doesn’t need to present much more complica -  tion than using any other skill. Instead of looking at the  "how" of the spell, focus on the end result to decide on a  difficulty for the check. If the spell is basically replicat -  ing the effects of a mundane skill, assign the difficulty  correspondingly, but consider increasing it by one.  Magic shouldn’t be a catchall skill that eliminates the  need for any others. Magically levitating over a river is  more difficult than swimming across from an objective  view, although your character might find it easier if they  aren’t trained in Athletics (or don't want to get wet).  Resolving a magic skill check is really no different from  resolving any other check. If the check succeeds, the  l earning   M agi C  Magic skills are potent and incredibly versatile.  Although we suggest rules restrictions on train -  ing magic skills, as the GM you might want to  consider imposing additional in-game require -  ments. Not only does this add more challenge  for PCs seeking such power, but it provides an  opportunity to underscore the rarity and power  of magic and to illustrate how it fits into your set -  ting. A character who wants to advance in Thau -  maturgy might be required to abide by the rules  of their religious order to receive training. You  may require a would-be wizard to seek out a tutor  and convince them to accept an apprentice, or to  discover and study an ancient tome of spells.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 211  character achieves what they set out to. How exactly that  happens is shown by the positive and negative symbols  left in the pool, as interpreted by you and your players.  One good guideline for magic, however, is that accom -  plishing something through the use of magic should  rarely be as easy as accomplishing the same task by  using the skill designed for it.   Magic can be a generalist  skill, but it shouldn’t be a way to master everything.  Magic is more taxing than other activities in one other  respect.   When your character casts a spell that requires  a check (whether or not the check succeeds), they suffer  2 strain after resolving the check.   This limit keeps magic-  using characters from using magic indiscriminately. Note  that magic-using characters only suffer strain when they  need to make a check to cast a spell, so minor and narra -  tive spell effects do not impose this penalty.  Generally,   magic   also   has   unique   requirements  for use. The character may have to make certain ges -  tures, say specific words, or just spend a few precious  moments focusing on the spell. If your character can’t  do that, casting the spell becomes harder. See   Table  III.2–3: Penalties When Casting Spells,   on the previ -  ous page, for some conditions that may make it harder  for a character to cast a spell.  Magic can also be risky, and casting it can come with  consequences.   Table III.2–4: Spending   󲊱   and   󲊲   on  Magic Skill Checks   lays out some of the consequences,  and the   󲊱   and   󲊲   needed to trigger them. You may  note that the consequences tend to be worse than the  consequences characters normally suffer for   󲊱   and   󲊲 .  We did that deliberately, as a balance for magic’s power  and flexibility. After all, with great power comes the  occasional risk of turning yourself into a toad.  The effects of magic skill checks may be instanta -  neous or, rarely, permanent. Generally, spells used in  structured gameplay either have an immediate effect  or a persistent effect for as long as the character uses  maneuvers to concentrate on the spell. At your discre -  tion, outside of structured gameplay, some effects may  last for the duration of an encounter or scene.  t ypes   of   s pells  Since magic skills are more versatile—and thus poten -  tially more useful—than other skills, we narrow down  what is possible to accomplish with a particular magic  skill by defining broad categories of actions, or   spells .  For structured encounters, we divide spell types up fairly  rigorously. For narrative encounters, we keep things  more flexible but still follow those same guidelines.  In this section, we list the different types of spells and  talk about how to use them in narrative encounters. Later  we talk about using these spells in structured encounters.  Each spell entry talks about the things a character  can do with that spell—such as make themself invis -  ible, hex a target, or heal an ally. Often, we refer to  the   Magic in Structured Encounters   rules, starting  on page   214 , for particulars on how to use a spell to  accomplish a goal. Those rules work equally well for  narrative encounters.  Also, you’ll quickly note that none of the three magic  skills (Arcana, Divine, and Primal) are able to accomplish  all of the different types of spells. We did this deliberately;  each type of magic should be better at some things than  others, and this way no one character can be a master at  everything. We don’t recommend disregarding this rule,  since it makes magic users even more powerful.  TABLE III.2–4: SPENDING   󲊱   AND   󲊲   ON MAGIC SKILL CHECKS  Cost   Result Options  󲊱   or  󲊲  The magical energies exhaust the character, and they suffer 2 strain or 1 wound (controlling player's choice).  This character and all allied spellcasters in the encounter add   󲊸   to any attempts to cast spells until the end of the controlling player's next turn.  󲊱   󲊱  or   󲊲  The spell doesn’t take effect until the start of the next round, or after a minute in narrative gameplay.  If the character is using a magical item, it becomes damaged one step (see   Table I.5–4: Repairing Gear , on page   89 ).  Until the end of the encounter, enemy spellcasters add   󲊸   when casting a spell that targets this character.  󲊱   󲊱  󲊱   or  󲊲  The spell is slightly more powerful than expected. One character of the GM's choice is targeted or otherwise affected by the spell as well.

The GM picks the target of the character's spell. If the caster is an NPC, the controlling player picks the target of the spell instead.  󲊲   󲊲  The character completely lose control of their magical energies or draws the ire of their deity, suffering one Critical Injury (at the GM's  discretion, this may instead take the form of some of terrible or hilarious misfortune, such as temporarily being turned into a small woodland  creature, being struck by lightning on a clear day, swapping bodies with someone else in the encounter for the remainder of the day, or  summoning an avatar of divine or infernal wrath).  If the character is using a magical item, it is completely destroyed. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 212  a ttack  Skills:   Arcana, Divine, Primal  Attack spells include any combat check or other action  that directly or indirectly deals damage or strain to an  enemy. Examples include throwing a fireball, shooting  lightning, smiting a foe with magical force, or knocking  a foe around the battlefield with invisible blows.  We recommend using the rules found on page   215  for making a magic Attack action whenever you want  your character to attack someone with magic. Attack -  ing generally happens in structured combat encounters,  anyway. If you need to make an attack outside of combat  (by shooting a bolt of force to cause a landslide to block a  road, for example), your players can still follow the rules  for the magic Attack action, and you can decide on the  minimum damage needed to trigger the desired result.  a u G ment  Skills:   Divine, Primal  Augment spells magically enhance characters or objects.  Sometimes, the distinction is mostly narrative—it may be  purely a matter of description whether a spell imbues a  sword with power or improves the reflexes of the charac -  ter wielding it. Although these effects are often helpful in  combat, such spells can be useful in many circumstances,  from helping an ally scale a sheer surface to keeping the  party’s horses galloping past their normal limits.  When determining the effect of an augment spell,  see the Augment action’s effects, on pages   215   and  216 , for some of the possibilities. Of course, you or  your players may want to try something not covered by  those effects, such as temporarily repairing a weapon  so that you can continue to wield it. In this case, you  may set a difficulty by looking at the difficulty to repair  the item (see   Table I.5–4: Repairing Gear , on page  89 ). These spells could also be used to improve the  effectiveness of gear (perhaps the augmented item adds  󲊸   to checks related to its use). Augment could even  let a character turn invisible or fly, although we recom -  mend a difficulty of at least   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )   for this!  b arrier  Skills:   Arcana, Divine  "Barrier," or protective, spells are fairly straightforward  in structured encounters: they reduce incoming dam -  age for your character and their allies. However, they  have some interesting narrative uses as well.  Barrier magics let the spellcaster protect themself  from adverse conditions of all types. Your character  may create a bubble under the ocean so they can travel  underwater, a barrier that shields them from flames as  they walk through a burning building, or even a barrier  that deflects an onrushing avalanche. When using a Bar -  rier spell in narrative situations like these, first define  what you want the barrier to do (protect a character  from heat or cold, create a bubble of air, deflect snow in  an avalanche). Then, use the base difficulty for the check  as defined on page   216 , and follow the additional effects  rules if the character wants to affect other targets.  c onjure  Skills:   Arcana, Primal  Conjuration magic allows a character to summon allies  and create items out of the raw stuff of magic (whatever  that may be in your setting).  Conjure’s structured encounter rules, on page   216 ,  are fairly good guidance for using Conjure in narrative  encounters. However, we admit that the Conjure action  is one of the most loosely defined rule sets because of  the sheer number of items or creatures you could sum -  mon or create. When using Conjure to summon or cre -  ate something in a narrative encounter, what you need  to determine is the size or complexity of the conjuration.  How elaborate the spell gets can be a matter of common  sense for you and your players. Summoning a glowing  sword and fighting with it seems reasonable, but sum -  moning a cannon does not (especially if the cannon  doesn’t exist in your setting!) Likewise, summoning a  d ifferent   d is C iplines ,  d ifferent   a pproa C hes  Magic skills may be treated differently depend -  ing on the setting. In some settings, Divine,  Arcane, and Primal spellcasters each tap into  a different energy and are unable to access the  other powers. If your setting fits this description,  you may rule that once a character has taken a  rank in one of the three magic skills, they cannot  take ranks in the other magic skills.  In other settings, although the three magic skills  represent tapping into different energies, a trained  spellcaster can tap into any of those energies by  changing their approach or rituals. If your setting  fits this description, you may allow characters to  purchase ranks in all three skills (if that character  wants to be able to perform all types of magic).  Finally, in some settings, magic is a gift (or curse)  that only a select few individuals can manipulate.  In this case, you can rule that only characters who  have a magic skill as a career skill can buy ranks in  that skill. This makes magic use much more lim -  ited to a few characters in a party.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 213  door to bar a portal or brush and brambles to make an  area difficult terrain is within the scope of a spell, but  summoning a canyon filled with molten lava is not!  c urse  Skills:   Arcana, Divine  What we call a "Curse" is any sort of affliction that  applies a negative effect to a character, whether it be a  penalty to combat checks, a wasting sickness incurable  by mundane means, or an inability to speak a certain  name. The most extreme afflictions might even bend a  victim to the spellcaster’s will. The distinction between  affliction and attack might not always be clear. As a  general principle, if a magical action inflicts damage or  strain, it’s an attack. If it simply makes a target more  susceptible to damage or strain, it’s a curse.  Outside of structured encounters, curses could take  any number of forms. Some could be annoying, such as  someone sneezing uncontrollably or feeling inexplicably  lethargic. The effects could be represented mechanically  by adding a   󲊸   or two to the target’s checks. The check to  inflict such a minor curse should either be opposed (see  page   25 ), or   Easy ( 󲊷 )   if the target is a minor char -  acter. Other curses could be more dangerous, such as a  hex that causes dangerous things to happen to the target  for no reason (ladders breaking, tree branches falling on  them, and the like). Not only should the difficulty of the  spell be higher—if it’s not an opposed check, it should be  at least   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )   and possibly   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) —  but the effects can be represented narratively. If a char -  acter falls from a broken ladder, for example, use the  falling rules on page   112 .  Of course, there are some truly terrible curses: blind -  ness, disease, madness, or being turned into a toad.  These checks should almost always be opposed (either  by the target’s Discipline or Resilience, depending on  whether the curse affects the mind or the body). You  can pull effects from the   Table I.6–10: Critical Injury  Result   on page   115 , the fear and sanity rules on page  243   and   244 , or use similar inspiration when figur -  ing out what the curse does.  D   ispel  Skills:   Arcana  We’ve made dispelling an opponent’s  magics   the   province   of   Arcana  magic—primarily   to   balance  out   healing   being   limited  to the Divine and Primal  skills. (You may decide to  ignore   this   limitation   in  your own setting, but just  remember,   we   did   it   for  balance   reasons.)   Dispel -  ling should work the same  in   structured   encounters  and in narrative encoun -  ters, so just use the rules  on page   217   if a charac -  ter wants to dispel some -  thing narratively.  M aintaining   s pells   in   n arrative   e n C ounters  Quite a few of our spells are supposed to be  maintained over multiple rounds to provide an  ongoing effect. In structured encounters, your  character does this by performing the Con -  centration   maneuver.   However,   in   narrative  encounters, tracking individual maneuvers can  be unnecessarily tedious.  Instead, we suggest taking a more narrative  approach   to   concentration   and   maintaining  spells. You can decide that a character can't per -  form some activities while also concentrating  on a spell, such as tasks that might take a lot of  their attention. A character might also start suf -  fering strain if they try to maintain a spell over  time. Finally, if something happens that could  interrupt a character's concentration, you can  have your player make an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Disci -  pline check . Failure means their character loses  concentration, and the spell ends. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 214  h eal  Skills:   Divine, Primal  At its most basic, healing magic can remove damage or  strain from a character. The most powerful spells might  cure deadly diseases or even raise the dead. Healing  magic works much like the Medicine skill, but of course  medicine in most fantasy worlds is fairly primitive.  In game terms, healing magic is more difficult than an  equivalent Medicine check. However, in exchange for this  increased difficulty, healing magic can do things that a  skilled doctor cannot. These include healing targets from  afar, healing multiple targets at once, and on rare occa -  sions, bringing the deceased back from the dead. Healing  magic can also affect targets multiple times per encounter.  When using healing magic, the additional affects listed  in   Table III.2–11   should cover most of what you want to  do in narrative time as well as structured time. For other  effects—such as a spell to double the rate of natural heal -  ing for a target—you, the GM, can set the difficulty. If  you’re not sure what difficulty to assign,   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )  works for any acceleration of natural healing, while any -  thing similar in scope and impact to bringing the dead  back to life should be   Daunting ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )   or even  Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) . Generally, we recommend  making resurrection a rare and difficult endeavor, so that  death doesn’t lose its impact in your game.  u tility  Skills:   Arcana, Divine, Primal  Utility magic covers all the minor things that we expect  people to be able to do with magic, such as levitating a  book, transmuting a pebble into a butterfly, detecting  something magical nearby, summoning a ghostly light  source to see in the dark, or making one’s voice growl  with distant thunder. Basically, these are all cool abilities  with a minor benefit, but are more tricks than dangerous  or powerful magics. That doesn’t mean a player can’t fig -  ure out how their character can use a utility spell to their  best advantage—that’s half the fun of being a spellcaster!  Utility magic doesn’t have an equivalent action for  structured   encounters,   since   the   effects   are   almost  entirely narrative in nature. A check to cast a utility spell  should always be   Easy ( 󲊷 ) . If that check seems too easy  for what you want to accomplish, then what you want to  do is probably beyond the scope of utility magic!  m a G ic   in   s tructure D   e ncounters  Magic can be used to attack opponents, protect allies,  summon items or weapons, and do other impressive and  amazing things. The core of these actions follows the  same skill check system that forms the core of   Genesys .  The difference is that magic is much more customizable.  You can do quite a bit with magic, but the more you want  to do, the more difficult the check becomes.  m a G ic   a ctions   an D   m aneuvers  As with anything else characters might attempt in  structured encounters, spells are categorized as either  actions or maneuvers. This section presents example  magic actions that cover some of the most common  things characters might attempt. We try to leave the  narrative descriptions up to you and your players; it’s  fun to describe the appearance of spells in ways unique  to your characters. These actions are presented in the  same format as those in   Part I–Chapter 6: Combat  Encounters , and they can be used alongside other  combat actions. Like standard actions and maneuvers,  many of these can also be used outside of combat.  Again, these are only examples of what characters  might do with magic—common uses that we thought  could use some detail and guidance. As you’ve doubtless  already guessed, adjudicating activities other than those  described here is up to you and your players.  a ctions  Here are a few of the most likely actions characters might  attempt using magic. Of course, these are just some of  the possibilities, and GMs, you can use these as guide -  lines for creating your own magic actions if you like.  Each entry specifies whether the spell can be sustained  using the Concentration maneuver and what skills can  be used to perform the action. Not all skills can be used  to perform each action; some magic skills are better at  performing certain kinds of magic than others.   A char -  acter must have at least one rank in the skill required  by the magic action to perform that magic action.  r esisting   M agi C  High-level adversaries such as nemeses usually  have a rank or three in the Adversary talent,  which makes them more of a challenge in a fight.  The Adversary talent upgrades the difficulty of  combat checks targeting the NPC, and this obvi -  ously applies to Attack spells. However, other  spells may seem like a way to get around the  Adversary talent. Therefore, we recommend that  you upgrade the difficulty of   any   spells targeting  an NPC a number of times equal to that NPC's  ranks in Adversary. This should be enough to  make nemeses feel dangerous. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 215  Where magic gets interesting is in the options a char -  acter has for customizing their spell. Before making a  magic action, the character may choose any number  of additional effects to add to that action (these effects  are listed on an associated table). However, each effect  has a difficulty increase associated with it. You add  each difficulty increase to the overall difficulty of the  check. You may not add an effect if it would increase  the difficulty beyond   Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 )   (after  any reductions, such as from magic implements, are  applied; see page   218 ). Each effect can be added once,  unless the effect specifies otherwise.  Since all magic actions require a check (and are thus  spells that require a check), whenever a character per -  forms a magic action, they suffer 2 strain.  a ttack  Concentration:   No  Skills:   Arcana, Divine, Primal  Magic attacks are combat checks, and they follow the nor -  mal rules for performing a combat check, on page   101 ,  using the character’s magic skill instead of a combat skill.  There are some exceptions, however, which we detail here.  When making a magic attack, the character must select  one target at short range (but not engaged). The default  difficulty of the check is   Easy ( 󲊷 ) . The attack deals dam -  age equal to the characteristic linked to the skill used to  make the attack (so if the character uses Arcana, they  would deal damage equal to their Intellect), plus 1 damage  per uncanceled   󲊳 . The attack has no set Critical rating, so  you may only inflict a Critical Injury with a   󲊵 .  Before making a magic attack check, choose any  number of additional effects listed on   Table III.2–5:  Magic Attack Additional Effects . These effects are  added to the attack.  a u G ment  Concentration:   Yes  Skills:   Divine, Primal  This is using magic to enhance people. A character selects  one target they are engaged with (which can be themself),  then makes a Primal or Divine skill check. The default  difficulty of the check is   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) . If the check is  successful, until the end of your character’s next turn, the  target increases the ability of any skill checks they make  by one (in effect, this means they add   󲊷   to their checks).  TABLE III.2–5: MAGIC ATTACK ADDITIONAL EFFECTS  Effects   Difficulty Mod  Blast:   The attack gains the Blast quality with a rating equal to your character's ranks in Knowledge.   +   󲊷  Close Combat:   May select a target engaged with your character.   +   󲊷  Deadly:   The attack gains a Critical rating of 2.

This counts as a poison.   +   󲊷   󲊷 Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 216  A character may not be affected by more than one Aug -  ment spell at the same time (so no stacking effects).

These effects are added to the check.  b arrier  Concentration:   Yes  Skills:   Arcana, Divine  Both arcane and divine spellcasters have the power to  create barriers of magical energy to protect themselves  and their allies.

If the check is successful, the character sum -  mons a simple tool with no moving parts (such as a  shovel or pickax), a one-handed melee weapon with no  moving parts (such as a sword or knife), or a minion  no bigger than silhouette 1 (such as an animal, magi -  cal creature, elemental spirit, or even undead mon -  strosity). These appear engaged with the character. The  summoned minion or item remains present until the  end of the character’s next turn.  If the character summons a creature, the creature  behaves in the best approximation of its natural instincts  (as determined by the GM). It is not controlled by the  character, and may even be hostile to them. In a structured  encounter, it takes its turn immediately after the character.

These effects are added to the check.  m aneuvers  These maneuvers are specific to characters who use  magic skills. Like most maneuvers, these don’t actually  require checks, but affect the character’s skill checks.  Of course, you and your players might also describe  common maneuvers in terms of magic when it seems  appropriate. For instance, a player might describe  guarded stance (page   99 ) as their character focusing  their attention on erecting a minor magical barrier, or  they might narrate assist (page   98 ) as a subtle push of  magical energy to guide an ally’s sword strike.  c ounterspell  Most skilled mages or spellcasters can attempt to coun -  ter an opponent’s spells as they are being cast. If the char -  acter performs the counterspell maneuver, all opponents  within medium range upgrade the difficulty of checks to  cast spells once, until the end of the character's next turn.  c oncentrate  Some magical effects might require concentration to  sustain. If a magical action (or spell) can benefit from  concentration, the action description notes this.  Spells that can be sustained through concentration  last until the end of the character’s next turn (as noted  in their description). However, if the character performs  the concentrate maneuver during that next turn, the  spell’s effects last until the end of the character’s follow -  ing turn, instead. This can be sustained indefinitely by  performing the concentrate maneuver each turn.  m a G ic   i mplements  Magic, as with any other skill, can be augmented and  enhanced by various items. You may recognize them as  magical staples such as staffs, wands, and orbs. We call  them   magic implements , and they’re a type of equipment.  Each of our magic implements, or tools, has a cer -  tain basic effect (all staffs help your character increase  the range of spells, for example). We selected these  basic effects for simplicity and ease of explanation.  However, if in your setting you prefer that wands help  your spellcasters increase the range of a spell, then  just swap the basic abilities around between types  of items. Most of the magic tools also boost the base  damage of attack spells. This represents magic doing  more damage when focused correctly, and it brings  the damage totals in line with regular weapons.  There are two hard-and-fast rules when it comes to  using magic implements, however. The first is that your  character can only benefit from one implement at a time.  So, if your character has an orb and a wand, for example,  they choose which one to use when casting a spell. The  second is that holding an implement does not impose   󲊸  on your character’s check for not having their hands free.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 219  D   rui D ic   c irclets  Druidic circlets could be simple bands of entwined  metal, elaborate headdresses of antlers, or even crowns  of ivy. They help those using primal magic commune  with the natural world.  When the user casts the Conjure spell to summon a  living creature, adding the Summon Ally effect does not  increase its difficulty. In addition, the creature remains  summoned until the end of the encounter without your  character having to use the concentrate maneuver.  h oly   i cons  Holy icons are items that represent your character’s  faith and help them focus that faith to cast spells. These  are generally religious symbols of some sort, perhaps  necklaces, rings, emblems, or medallions. But they just  as easily can simply represent your character’s beliefs.  Holy icons enable divine spellcasters to perform  unique miracles. When they are casting a spell, add -  ing any Divine Only effects increase the spell’s diffi -  culty one less than they would normally. In addition,  the number of wounds healed by heal spells cast by the  user increases by two.  m a G ic   o rbs  These can be orbs of glass, gems, or other semitransparent  minerals, and are generally small enough to be carried.  Magic orbs help augment the user’s ability to affect  more targets with their spells. When the user casts a  spell, adding the Additional Target and Additional  Summon effects do not increase its difficulty. In addi -  tion, attack spells cast by the user increase their base  damage by three.  m a G ic   r in G s  Magic rings are items of great power and danger in  most fantasy settings. We decided to stick with that  theme, so our rings are items of great power and peril.  When a character obtains a magic ring, you, the GM,  choose one type of magic skill, then select three effects  that can be added to spells cast by that skill. Two of the  effects can normally only increase the difficulty of the  spell by one; the third can normally only increase the dif -  ficulty of the spell by two. When the user casts a spell,  adding these effects do not increase the spell’s difficulty.  However, when using a magic ring, you must always  upgrade the difficulty of any spells you cast once, and   󲊲  󲊲   cannot be spent to destroy the ring. In addition, attack  spells cast by the user increase their base damage by two.  An example of this might be a ring of protection,  which allows your character to add the Range, Addi -  tional Target, and Reflection effects to a Barrier spell  without increasing the difficulty.  m a G ic   s taffs  Magical staffs have long been a staple of magic in a  variety of settings. Used by wizards, druids, and sha -  mans, these can look like ornate, rune-encrusted rods  of brass and obsidian, simple wooden staffs, or pretty  much anything else.  Magical   staffs   almost   universally   augment   the  user’s ability to cast spells at range. When they are  casting a spell, adding the first Range effect added  to the spell does not increase the spell’s difficulty. In  addition, attack spells cast by the user increase their  base damage by four.  m a G ic   W   an D s  Magical wands are as much a tradition of magic as staffs.  Usually small sticks about the size and shape of a con -  ductor’s baton, they can be constructed from just about  anything and worked with any number of designs.  Magic wands help augment the user’s ability to cast  spells in a very specific way. When a character makes  or obtains the wand, you, the GM, determine one effect  that the wand lets users add to any appropriate spell  without increasing the spell’s difficulty. The effect cho -  sen must be one that, without a wand, only increases  difficulty by one. In addition, attack spells cast by the  user increase their base damage by three.  For example, your character could have a wand of  fire, which lets them add the Fire effect to any magic  attack actions they perform. They could also have a  wand of enervation, which lets them add the Enervate  effect to any curse actions they perform. However, they  cannot have a wand of grand summoning, because the  Grand Summon effect increases the difficulty of the  spell by two, not one.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 220  v ehi C le   r ules  S ome games make interactions with   vehicles abstract  enough that you don’t need special rules to gov -  ern them. However, other games prominently feature  mechanized walkers, gadget-filled sports cars, and  interplanetary starships. This section provides vehicle  rules that integrate directly with   Genesys , opening up  these options to imaginative GMs and players.  v ehicle   c haracteristics  All vehicles are defined through a number of charac -  teristics. These characteristics delineate such attributes  as the strength of a starship’s shields or how quickly  a race car accelerates off the line. The characteristics  described here cover the bulk of important mechanical  information about vehicles.  •   Handling:   The measure of a vehicle’s agility and  how well it responds to its pilot.  •   Maximum Speed:   A vehicle’s top speed.  •   Silhouette:   An abstract of the vehicle’s size.  •   Defense:   A vehicle’s first line of defense against attack  and accident. Typically representative of a starship’s  ray shields and particle shields, defense also repre -  sents any factors, technological or otherwise, that  prevent damage from reaching a vehicle’s armor.  •   Armor:   The measure of a vehicle’s armor, similar  to soak on the personal scale.  •   Hull Trauma Threshold:   A reflection of the stur -  diness of a vehicle’s construction and its ability to  sustain damage and keep operating.  •   System Strain Threshold:   The limit to which a vehi -  cle can be pushed or knocked about before important  systems overload or shut down.  h an D lin G  Handling reflects a vehicle’s inherent agility and the  ways in which it responds to its pilot and crew.  Enormous   sailing   ships   might   require  incredible effort on the part of many  crew members to turn, while advanced  starships   might   have   automated  assistance to help pilots avoid  obstacles and maneuver opti -  mally. Factors such as shape,  control systems, mass, or  just general awkwardness  all contribute to handling.  Mechanically, a vehicle’s handling characteristic dic -  tates the number of   󲊸   or   󲊸   added to your PC’s dice pool  when making Piloting checks. Pilots add   󲊸   equal to a  vehicle’s negative handling value or   󲊸   equal to a vehicle’s  positive handling value. See   Table III.2–13: Handling  Examples   for types of vehicles and their handling.  m aximum   s pee D  An abstraction of both speed and acceleration, a vehi -  cle’s speed characteristic dictates how fast it moves rela -  tive to its environment and what maneuvers are avail -  able to the pilot. The listed speed is the maximum value  at which the vehicle can travel. Vehicles can travel at  speeds lower than their maxi -  mum listed value. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 221  e ffects   of   c urrent   s pee D  When using vehicles, you should always track their cur -  rent speed. A vehicle may be operating at any speed from  zero to its maximum. Vehicle maneuvers can be used to  accelerate or decelerate (see   Maneuvers   on page   226 ).  Additionally, while a vehicle’s current speed is 1 or  higher, certain other effects apply to it (see   Table III.2–  14: Vehicle Speeds in Structured Encounters ).  s teerin G  Each round, a vehicle moves a certain distance based  on its current speed. The pilot’s job, in theory, is to con -  trol this momentum so as to keep the occupants alive.  When your character is piloting a vehicle, they must  steer the craft. At the beginning or end of their turn each  round, you must have the vehicle move a certain number  of range bands based on its speed, as detailed in   Table  III.2–14: Vehicle Speeds in Structured Encounters .  A vehicle generally goes where the pilot wants it to as  part of this movement. However, given that player char -  acters are known for attempting to ignore such petty con -  straints as safety manuals, road signs, and consideration  of the laws of physics, you can always require the pilot  to perform the dangerous driving action (see page   227 )  to reach their intended destination (if doing is possible).  Zigzagging through obstacles, turns harsher than ninety  degrees, and anything involving safe embarkation or dis -  embarkation without coming to a full stop should almost  certainly require the pilot to use this action. If the pilot  fails, you, the GM, determine the final position (and con -  dition) of the vehicle, but at a minimum it should veer off  course, and at worst, it might suffer a collision with one or  more intervening objects (see   Collisions , on page   222 ).

Upgrade the  difficulty of all Piloting checks twice.  Add +40 to the result of any Critical Hit  suffered as a result of a collision (see  Collisions , on page   222 ).  v ehi C le   C o M ponents  Most vehicles have a number of components, and these  components can be damaged. We list the components  and describe what happens when they become dam -  aged (generally from a Critical Hit) here:  Brakes:   If a vehicle’s brakes are compromised, its  pilot cannot perform the decelerate maneuver. The  vehicle can still coast to a stop over a long distance,  or stop by colliding with something.  Defenses:   If a vehicle’s defenses are compromised,  reduce its defense to 0.  Hull:   If a vehicle’s hull is compromised, its armor  becomes 0.  Navigation:   If a vehicle’s navigation is compromised,  its handling becomes –3 (unless already lower).  Propulsion:   Propulsion in any form is what moves  a vehicle. If a vehicle’s propulsion is compromised,  its pilot cannot perform the accelerate maneuver,  and its current speed drops by one each round, to  a minimum of 0.  Weapons:   Some vehicles are armed with one or more  weapons. If a weapon is compromised, it cannot be  used (see   Item Maintenance , on page   89 ).  Repairing components requires a Mechanics check.  Often the difficulty is determined by the severity of the  Critical Hit; otherwise, it should be   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 )   or  Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) , at you, the GM's, discretion. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 222  If a vehicle has more than one pilot, steering only  occurs on the turn of the first pilot to act each round. If  a vehicle has no pilot who can steer it, it still moves—but  it does so at the end of the round, and you determine its  location and any objects it might hit along the way.  c ollisions  There are occasions when vehicles will run into the ter -  rain around them, or into another nearby vehicle. In  these cases, there are two possible types of collisions:  glancing blows (minor collisions) and head-on hits  (major collisions). Collisions can be mitigated by ship’s  or vehicle’s defenses.  In the case of a minor collision, all vehicles involved  suffer a single Critical Hit (see   Vehicle Critical Hits ,  on page   231 ). Subtract the vehicle’s defense times 10  from the rolled on   Table III.2–19: Critical Hit Result ,  on page   230 . If the result is reduced to zero or less, the  vehicle’s shields or other defenses have nullified the col -  lision entirely, and the Critical Hit is canceled.  In the case of a major collision, all vehicles involved  suffer a single Critical Hit as well. Subtract the vehicle’s  defense times 5 from the Critical Hit result. If the result  is reduced to zero or less, the Critical Hit is canceled.  At your discretion, some particularly large vehicles  might be able to ignore collisions with very small vehi -  cles. However, larger vehicles have a harder time avoid -  ing collisions with terrain features.  s ilhouette  Much like the speed characteristic, silhouette is an  abstract number, used to describe a vehicle’s size and  mass relative to other vehicles. Silhouette factors heavily  into scale and is used to calculate the difficulty of attack -  ing targets of different sizes. Generally, large vehicles are  easy to hit, and small vehicles are hard to hit.  Silhouettes range from 0 to 10 (or even higher). Silhou -  ette 0 is smaller than a human, silhouette 1 is about the  size of an adult human, and silhouette 2 is the size of most  cars and large animals. Fighter jets, cargo planes, and  tractor-trailer trucks range from silhouette 3 to 4. Navy  battleships and starships range from silhouette 5 to 10.  h ull   t rauma   t hreshol D  Hull trauma threshold is a reflection of a vehicle’s stur -  diness and resistance to damage. The sturdiness of a  ship’s hull and mast, the quality of a bicycle’s chain and  gears, and the resilience of a tank’s frame are all repre -  sented by hull trauma threshold. Hull trauma gener -  ally requires major body work on the vehicle to repair,  which can be extremely costly.  Like the wound threshold of a player character,   hull  trauma threshold represents the amount of physical  damage that a vehicle can suffer before it is rendered  inoperable or destroyed. In game terms, when a vehicle  exceeds its hull trauma threshold, one of two things  happen. If it is occupied only by unimportant char -  acters, such as minion NPCs, it is simply destroyed—  crashes and crumples, flips over, or explodes. If it is  occupied by plot-relevant characters, such as the PCs or  rival/nemesis NPCs, it suffers a Critical Hit (see   Vehi -  cle Critical Hits,   on page   231 ) and becomes inoper -  able. Until its hull trauma is reduced to its hull trauma  threshold or below, all of its components are compro -  mised (see   Vehicle Components , on page   221 ).  Hull trauma threshold is measured in planetary scale  (see   Planetary Scale versus Personal Scale , on page  224 ), meaning that one point of hull trauma equals 10  wounds on an individual.  r epairing   h ull   t rau M a  While system strain and the results of some  Critical Hits are temporary, hull trauma is more  permanent.   Repairing   hull   trauma   requires  three things: proper facilities, money, and time.  Proper facilities have enough tools, light, parts,  and workspace to make the repairs to the vehicle.  We recommend paying 100 to repair 1 hull trauma,  but the cost can fluctuate based on your characters’  reputation, the scarcity of parts, and other factors  at your discretion as GM. A good rule of thumb is  that light damage (up to a quarter of a vehicle’s total  hull trauma threshold) should take an amount of  time measured in days, while any damage over that  takes weeks or even months to repair.  e M ergen C y   r epairs  The pilot or crew of a vehicle with hull trauma  that   exceeds   its   hull   trauma   threshold   may  attempt emergency repairs by scavenging all  available parts from the vehicle and making  a   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Mechanics check . Success  brings the vehicle back to some semblance of  life. The vehicle reduces its hull trauma to one  point below its hull trauma threshold, but its  defenses, hull, navigation, and weapons remain  compromised until it receives more time-inten -  sive repairs.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 223  s ystem   s train   t hreshol D  System strain threshold represents a vehicle’s ability to  function under rigorous use and the point at which it  overheats, depletes its power source, or otherwise ceases  functioning. A sailing ship’s   system strain threshold  might represent the quality of moving parts like the til -  ler and ropes, while that of a futuristic battle-suit might  represent the state of its cutting-edge reactor.  Most often, a vehicle suffers system strain due to the  actions of its crew, as they push it to (or beyond) its break -  ing point. Driving a tank over rough ground or sailing a  ship through a storm might well cause it system strain,  as might pushing the engine of a car beyond its intended  limits. You can also spend   󲊱   on the pilot’s checks to inflict  system strain on a vehicle, representing the character’s  haste or carelessness causing stress to the craft.  Like the strain threshold of a player character,   system  strain represents the stress that the vehicle can tolerate  before it overheats, breaks down, overloads, or gener -  ally ceases functioning temporarily. In game terms,  when a vehicle exceeds its system strain threshold, the  vehicle’s speed drops to 0 at the beginning of the fol -  lowing round. Until its system strain is reduced to its  system strain threshold or below, its components cease  functioning, as described in the   Vehicle Components  sidebar, on page   221 .  System strain is measured in planetary scale (see page  224 ), meaning that one point of system strain equals  10 strain. It is important to note that, unlike personal  strain, system strain cannot be recovered by spending  󲊴 . It can only be restored through actions taken by the  crew or slowly over time.  p rotection  In general terms, a vehicle’s protection is an amalgam of  its maneuverability, the durability of its hull or chassis,  the strength of its shields, and the thickness of its armor.  In some settings, vehicles have simple protections like  thick wood and metal plating, while in others, they are  protected by reactive armor, diamond-hard carbon pan -  els, or even energy fields that absorb oncoming attacks.  Genesys   divides these protections into two discrete  statistics: defense and armor.  D   efense  Defense   reflects   a   vehicle’s   ability   to   completely  deflect or reduce the damage of incoming attacks or  collisions through ablative armor, deflector shields,  point defense systems, illusory duplicates, or other,  even more esoteric technologies.  Defense works the same as described on page   104 ;  each point of a vehicle’s defense adds   󲊸   to any incoming  attack roll (melee or ranged) made against the vehicle.  a rmor  Armor is a flying vehicle’s second line of defense, and  the only protection available to the majority of ground  vehicles. It represents deflective plating of all varieties,  and it soaks up damage from attacks and impacts that  are able to penetrate a vehicle’s defense.  A vehicle’s armor soaks a number of damage points  equal to its rating. Remember that because it functions  on planetary scale, one point of a vehicle’s armor is  equivalent to ten points of soak on a personal scale (see  Planetary Scale versus Personal Scale , on page   224 ).  v ehicle   W eapons  Vehicle weapons share a number of characteristics. These  weapons are very similar to those found in   Part I–Chap -  ter 5: Equipmen t (page   82 ), with some differences.  •   Range:   This is the maximum range of the weapon.  Vehicle-mounted weapons use an additional range  band for distances—strategic—as described in   Plan -  etary Scale versus Personal Scale , on page   224 .  •   Damage:   This number is the base damage the weapon  inflicts with a successful attack. For every   󲊳   gener -  ated during the attack, the attacker adds +1 damage  to the base damage. Unless a vehicle weapon has the  Personal Scale quality (see   Planetary Scale versus  Personal Scale,   on page   224 ), remember that each  point of damage from a vehicle weapon is equivalent  to ten points of damage on the personal scale.  •   Critical Hit Rating:   Vehicles suffer Critical Hits  rather than Critical Injuries, and this rating is the  r e M oving   s yste M   s train  While the situation aboard a vehicle that has  exceeded its system strain threshold is indeed  dire, not all is lost. Any crew member can aid the  vehicle in removing system strain by perform -  ing repairs and damage control such as reboot -  ing systems, bypassing fried circuits, and putting  out electrical fires. This is accomplished through  the damage control action (see page   228 ).  Vehicles also recover from system strain slowly  over time. For every full day a vehicle spends  without taking more system strain, it reduces its  total system strain by one. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

number of   󲊴   required to trigger a Critical Hit on a  vehicle with the weapon. If enough   󲊴   is generated  and a Critical Hit is triggered, the character firing  the weapon rolls 1d100 on   Table III.2–19: Critical  Hit Result   on page   230 , to determine the Critical  Hit’s effect on the target. Some weapons and talents  modify this Critical Hit roll, potentially making it  more or less effective. In addition, a character can  only generate one Critical Hit per hit on a target.  However, if the roll generates enough   󲊴   to result  in multiple Critical Hits, the character can choose  to add an additional +10 per additional Critical  Hit to the roll result.  •   Fire Arc:   The direction or directions a weapon can  be fired, based on its mounting. These are specified  in individual vehicle profiles, and are generally a  narrative constraint rather than a hard mechani -  cal limitation. For instance, a forward-mounted  weapon cannot fire on a target behind the vehicle,  but a turret-mounted weapon can rotate to fire at  any target not obstructed by the vehicle’s hull.  •   Special   Qualities:   Many   weapons   have   addi -  tional item qualities that affect their performance.  Descriptions of these special effects are found on  page   86   of   Part I–Chapter 5: Equipment .  p lanetary   s C ale   versus   p ersonal   s C ale  V ehicles are bigger than people. They also tend to  move faster, and if they have weapons, those weap -  ons are much more powerful than something a person can  carry. To represent this, we’ve created something called  planetary scale   (as opposed to   personal scale , which is  what your characters operate in most of the time).  Planetary scale is just personal scale, but expanded.  To accommodate a vehicle’s expanded range (and  sometimes the expanded range of its weapons), we  added in a sixth range band,   strategic range . Vehicle  weapons also operate at planetary scale, which  means they do much more damage then per -  sonal scale weapons. We discuss both of  these points here.  s trate G ic   r an G e  Strategic range is a sixth range band that represents  distances beyond extreme range. At this range, people  cannot see one another with the naked eye, nor can  they interact without technological assistance—thus, it  is not included in the standard five range bands. How -  ever, when you are using a vehicle, especially one with  advanced sensors or other magnification technologies,  this is the farthest range at which you can interact with  targets. Vehicles can generally detect one another at  strategic range unless one or both are going out of their  way to be stealthy, but they cannot pinpoint infantry at  this distance without sensors, spotters, or similar assets. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 225  Indirect-fire weapons such as artillery often function  at strategic range, as do self-guided weapons like homing  missiles and torpedoes. However, most vehicle weapons  (such as a fighter jet’s machine guns or a sailing ship’s can -  nons) do not function at strategic range, and have ranges  of long or extreme instead. As a general rule, we limit most  weapons requiring direct line of sight to extreme range.  As strategic range is the sixth range band, the diffi -  culty of making ranged combat checks at strategic range  is   Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) .  p lanetary   s cale   c ombat  When dealing with a vehicle’s weapons, armor, and hull  trauma threshold, every point is equal to ten points  of the equivalent characteristic in the personal scale.  For example, a machine gun with a base damage of 3  mounted on a helicopter deals three points of damage  when fired at another vehicle, but thirty points of dam -  age when fired at a human. Conversely, a human-sized  assault rifle would need to deal ten points of damage to  a helicopter to inflict even one point of damage on it.  Note that planetary scale weapons deal massive  amounts of damage to individuals. Most hits deal  enough damage to far exceed a character’s wound  threshold,   automatically   incapacitating   the   target.  However, you may feel this is insufficient to represent  the power of these weapons, so you may have charac -  ters add +50 to the resulting Critical Injury roll. (Also,  those “hit” by a planetary scale weapon might be on the  periphery of the blast zone, explaining why they sur -  vived somewhat unscathed.)  Also note that to avoid having weapons such as  pistols dealing Critical Hits to heavily armored com -  bat craft, their damage must exceed a starship’s armor  before the shot can inflict a Critical Hit.  i tem   Q   uality   :   p ersonal   s cale  This quality exists only for vehicle weapons. We use this  quality when we want to put small-scale weapons on a  vehicle, such as the machine guns on the side of a com -  bat helicopter, or a grenade launcher on an APC.  The quality has the following rule:   this vehicle weap -  on’s entire profile uses personal scale instead of plan -  etary scale .  v ehi C le   C o M bat  C ombat engagements between vehicles function  using the same basic combat rules as found in   Part  I–Chapter 6: Combat Encounters , starting on page  95 . Vehicle combat is not intended to be a completely  separate rules system. Instead, it is designed to be an  added layer of detail on the standard combat rules that  allows you to run structured gameplay encounters  using characters, vehicles, or both.  v ehicle   c ombat   o vervie W  Vehicle combat in   Genesys   follows the same order  and rules as those detailed in   Part I–Chapter 6: Com -  bat Encounters . This section includes guidance for  using vehicles in combat, and certain additional rules  to facilitate the use of vehicles in battle.  s mall   v ehicle   c ombat  Combat between small vehicles like tanks, fighter  jets, personal spacecraft, or attack walkers is relatively  straightforward. The pilot has one vehicle maneuver  and one vehicle action (or two vehicle maneuvers) dur -  ing each turn.  Small vehicle combat (especially with high-speed  vehicles like fighter jets) is quite abstracted. As they  constantly move and strive for the advantage (thanks  to their incredible speed and agility), it would be nearly  impossible to map out every move a fighter jet makes.  Instead, you and your players describe the actions the  characters take, embellish them with narrative flair,  and then make skill checks to resolve the actions.  r ange   b ands   in   s pa C e  Space is really, really big. When we discuss  range bands on page   105 , it doesn't seem like  those distances are big enough to really repre -  sent the distances in space. However, the beauty  of range bands is that they're not tied to a spe -  cific, measurable distance. So, we recommend  that when you use vehicles in space, you scale  up the ranges slightly. Engaged may be two  spacecraft docked with each other, and short  and medium range may be only slightly farther  than their equivalents on the ground. But long  range and extreme range may represent hun -  dreds of kilometers, while strategic range may  represent thousands. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 226  c apital   s hip   c ombat  Combat in larger, capital-class vehicles such as battle -  ships (of the aquatic or stellar variety) is, by necessity,  more abstract due to their complexity and the number  of crew members involved. Like small vehicles in com -  bat, capital ships can only perform one vehicle maneu -  ver and one vehicle action (or two vehicle maneuvers)  during their turn, as directed by the pilot or captain.  Along with the pilot, each additional crew member  can use their personal actions and maneuvers to crew  weapons, operate sensors, move about the ship, and gen -  erally engage in combat. This all happens in the same  round, and it is subject to Initiative order just like per -  sonal   combat.   Something   to   remember   concerning  vehicle combat with capital ships is that each capital ship  is likely to have hundreds or thousands of crew. GMs  and players should not track all of their Initiative slots  and actions during combat. Instead, only focus on those  individuals who are doing things pertinent to the ongo -  ing encounter, and feel free to ignore the rest.  m ixe D   p ersonal   an D   v ehicle   c ombat  Sometimes,   characters   might   engage   with   vehicles  despite being on foot, or a battle might contain armor  and infantry elements. Characters on foot might even  be pursued by enemies with small vehicles like motor -  cycles or horses, or a character might be thrown from  their vehicle mid-battle. In such cases, the characters in  vehicles behave as if they are involved in a small vehicle  combat (or even a capital ship combat), while those out -  side of vehicles take their turns as usual, as described in  Part I–Chapter 6: Combat Encounters   (see page   95 ).  Although foot soldiers generally do not appreci -  ate fighting tanks, they do have one advantage: they  are harder to hit than most vehicles. As smaller tar -  gets, they are harder to hit, whereas infantry can hit  tanks with ease, even if they struggle to damage them.  Although difficulty for combat checks is set based on  range, smaller individuals still get bonuses for attack -  ing things larger than they are (see page   109 ).  c ombat   t urns  Much like personal combat, combat between vehicles  in   Genesys   is largely an abstract, narrative-driven  activity designed for quickness and ease of use. As such,  the maneuvers a vehicle performs are open to narration  and the interpretation of you and your players.  Player character pilots follow the same rules of combat  as detailed on page   95 . This means they can perform  one action and one maneuver during their turn. They  may also be able to perform a second maneuver by either  suffering strain or spending   󲊴 , although they cannot  take more than two maneuvers during their turn.  m aneuvers  Less involved than actions, maneuvers are simple activ -  ities that do not typically require a skill check. Beyond  all the maneuvers in personal combat, there are sev -  eral maneuvers that apply specifically to vehicles. These  additional maneuvers follow the usual rules governing  maneuvers (see page   97 ). In addition (and especially  in larger vehicles), characters are assumed to be able  to perform any personal maneuvers such as dropping  prone, managing gear, interacting with the environ -  ment, or aiming with vehicle or personal weapons  (although you should use common sense as to what a  character can and cannot do given the situation).  All maneuvers have a current speed, which is how fast  the vehicle has to be going to perform the maneuver.  a ccelerate  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   Any  Current Speed:   Any  The pilot may increase the vehicle’s current speed by one  or more, to a maximum of the vehicle’s maximum speed.  The vehicle suffers a number of system strain equal to the  amount its speed increased minus 1, to a minimum of 0.  p ilot   o nly   M aneuvers   and   a C tions  Some maneuvers and actions are specified as  “Pilot Only.” Pilot Only maneuvers and actions  affect the current speed and positioning of the  vehicle. As each vehicle has a cap on how far  and how swiftly it can move, its maneuvers and  actions are limited, as described below.  A vehicle can benefit from only one Pilot Only  action per round.  Additionally, a vehicle can benefit from one  Pilot Only maneuver per round, and it can  benefit from a second Pilot Only maneuver if it  suffers 2 system strain. If the vehicle has a sin -  gle pilot, the pilot must also suffer 2 strain (or  downgrade an action to a maneuver) to perform  two maneuvers, as per combat rules.  Some vehicles can have multiple pilots, in which  case two different pilots can each can perform a  Pilot Only maneuver. In such cases, the vehicle  suffers system strain for the second maneuver,  but the second pilot does not. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 227  b race   for   i mpact  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   Any  Speed:   Any  Once per round, the pilot may use this maneuver to  adjust the vehicle’s position to minimize incoming dam -  age. Until the beginning of the pilot’s next turn, when -  ever the vehicle is dealt damage, the pilot may have the  vehicle suffer system strain up to its silhouette to reduce  the damage it suffers by that amount, to a minimum of 0.  Additionally, until the beginning of the pilot’s next  turn, whenever the vehicle suffers a Critical Hit, the pilot  may have the vehicle suffer system strain up to its silhou -  ette to reduce the Critical Hit result by ten per point of  strain it gains this way, to a minimum of 0. If the result is  reduced to 0 this way, the Critical Hit is canceled.  D   ecelerate  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   Any  Current Speed:   1+  The pilot may decrease the vehicle’s current speed by  one or more, to a minimum of 0. The vehicle suffers a  number of system strain equal to the amount its speed  decreased minus 1, to a minimum of 0.  e va D e  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   0–4  Current Speed:   3+  Once per round, the pilot may perform this maneuver  to dodge incoming fire. Until the beginning of the pilot’s  next turn, upgrade the difficulty of all attacks made  against the vehicle and by characters in the vehicle.  r eposition  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   Any  Current Speed:   1+  The pilot may move the vehicle up to one range band.  This maneuver reflects minor repositioning to avoid  obstacles, close or widen distance in a chase, or other -  wise shift within the environment in small ways.  a ctions  In combat involving vehicles, your character can perform  some actions that specifically apply to their vehicle. Some  of these actions are labeled as Pilot Only actions. A vehicle  may benefit from only one Pilot Only action per round  (see   Pilot Only Maneuvers and Actions , on page   226 ).  Pilot Only actions are actions that affect the movement of  the vehicle itself, which may only move so fast and so far.  Like vehicle maneuvers, vehicle actions have a current  speed requirement that the vehicle has to be traveling at  to perform the action. Also remember that any of the  actions listed starting on page   101   of   Part I–Chapter 6:  Combat Encounters   can also be performed in combats  involving vehicles, within the bounds of common sense.

When performing the Dangerous Driving action, the  character makes a Piloting check with a difficulty equal  to the silhouette of the vehicle. Keep in mind that the  current speed of the vehicle can alter the difficulty of  such checks—and amplify the consequences of failure!  b lanket   b arra G e  Pilot Only:   No  Silhouette:   5+  Speed:   0–3  The gunner uses the ship’s weapons to raise a curtain of  fire around the ship, protecting it from smaller vehicles.  Any smaller vehicle attempting an attack run will must  brave a hurricane of heavy weaponry. This action also  speeds up combat when your vehicle has lots of guns.  When performing the Blanket Barrage action, your  character makes an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Gunnery check   and  selects all weapons of a single type that share a firing arc.  Those weapons count as firing that round. This action  requires at least two weapons to use, and it cannot be  used if there are not two weapons of a single type that  share a firing arc. Until the end of their next turn, all  vehicles of silhouette 4 or smaller upgrade the difficulty  of any combat checks made against your character’s vehi -  cle once, plus one additional time per   󲊴   󲊴   on the check.  If their combat check generates   󲊱   󲊱 , they suffer one  automatic hit, which deals half the base damage (round -  ing up) of the type of weapon used in the Blanket Barrage  action. If their combat check generates   󲊲 , they suffer one  automatic hit dealing the full base damage instead.  At your discretion, the Blanket Barrage might not  cover all arcs of the vehicle, leaving some areas open.  c oncentrate D   b arra G e  Pilot Only:   No  Silhouette:   5+  Speed:   0–3  The gunner directs the vehicle’s fire to focus on a precise  point on the opponent’s hull. Focusing fire in this way has  the potential to deal significant damage. This action also  speeds up combat when your vehicle has lots of guns.  When performing the Concentrated Barrage action,  the character selects all weapons of a single type (such  as 24-pounder cannons aboard a seagoing craft, or  railguns aboard a starship) that share a firing arc. This  action requires at least two weapons to use, and it can -  not be used if there are not two weapons of a single type  that share a firing arc. Although the character is firing  multiple weapons, the character makes a single combat  check, as per the rules for the Perform a Combat Check  with Vehicle Weapons action. If the attack succeeds, the  character may spend   󲊴   once to add damage equal to  the number of weapons involved in the attack to one hit  of the attack.  The Concentrated Barrage action can only be used to  target vehicles with a silhouette of 5 or higher.  D   ama G e   c ontrol  Pilot Only:   No  Silhouette:   Any  Speed:   Any  As a vehicle takes damage, sparks fly and systems begin  to fail. The Damage Control action can mitigate this  stress. When performing the Damage Control action,  choose whether you want your character to repair sys -  tem strain or hull trauma. Then, make a Mechanics  check, with the difficulty determined by   Table III.2–16:  Damage Control Difficulty . If the check is successful,  reduce the vehicle’s system strain or hull trauma by one  per uncanceled   󲊳 .  Characters can use the Damage Control action to  repair system strain multiple times during an encoun -  ter. However, only one Damage Control action can be  made to repair hull trauma during an encounter—no  matter how many characters are on the vehicle. In both  cases, you decide whether your players’ characters can  use the Damage Control action, depending on the cur -  rent situation (a fighter pilot probably couldn’t climb  out of their plane to patch their wing, after all).  Characters can also use this action to repair Criti -  cal Hits the vehicle is suffering from.

G   ain   the   a D vanta G e  Pilot Only:   Yes  Silhouette:   1–4  Speed:   4+  This action reflects the frantic give-and-take of a  dogfight between small vehicles. It allows a pilot to  gain the upper hand against a single enemy vehicle,  maneuvering to deny that foe shots while setting up  attacks of their own.  To execute this action, the pilot chooses one enemy  vehicle and makes a Driving or Piloting check, the dif -  ficulty of which is determined by the relative speeds of  the vehicles involved in the attack (see   Table III.2–18:  Speed Advantage Difficulty) . If the pilot succeeds,  they gain the advantage. While a pilot has the advan -  tage, upgrade the ability of all combat checks made  from the pilot’s vehicle against the target vehicle   twice ,  and upgrade the difficulty of all combat checks made  by the target vehicle against the pilot’s vehicle   twice .

On a successful check, each uncanceled   󲊳   reduces the   󲊸   suffered for difficult terrain by one.  Copilot   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Driving,  Piloting,   or   Operating check  The crew member serves as the vehicle’s copilot, managing systems and auxiliary equipment  to allow the pilot to focus on flying or driving. On a successful check, each uncancelled   󲊳  downgrades the difficulty of the pilot’s next Driving, Piloting, or Operating check once.  Jamming   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers check  The crew member uses the vehicle’s systems to jam the communications of enemy vehicles. On  a successful check, the enemy must make an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers check   to use its own  communication systems. The difficulty increases by one for each additional   󲊳   󲊳 , and the jamming  affects an additional target for each   󲊴   spent.  Boost  Defenses   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Mechanics check  The crew member reroutes power from other systems to boost the defensive systems of a vehicle.  This only works if the vehicle already has a defense of 1 or greater. On a successful check, the  vehicle suffers 1 system strain and increases the defense of the vehicle by one until the beginning of  the character’s next turn. Each additional   󲊳   increases the duration by one round.  Manual  Repairs   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Athletics check  In some cases, repairs can be as simple as welding a sturdy metal plate over a damaged system. If  the character has the proper tools for the job, they can attempt to use the Damage Control action  with Athletics rather than Mechanics. If successful, the character removes one point of hull trauma  from the vehicle, plus one additional point for each additional   󲊳   󲊳 . This follows the limitations of  the Damage Control action, and thus may only be attempted once per encounter.  Fire  Discipline  Hard   ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Leadership  or   Discipline check  The character forgoes fighting to analyze the opponents’ tactics and direct their comrades in  achieving greater accuracy with weapons fire. If the check is successful, the next crew member  firing a weapon on the vehicle adds   󲊸   to their check (plus an additional crew member for every  additional   󲊳   󲊳 ). The character may also spend   󲊴   󲊴   󲊴   to allow every hit from shipboard  weapons to inflict 1 system strain on their target as well as regular damage until the beginning of  the character’s next turn, as the carefully timed shots pummel shields and overload systems.  Scan the  Enemy   Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Perception check  The character uses the vehicle’s scanners to study the enemy. If successful, the character learns what  weapons the targeted vehicle has, its modifications, and its system strain and hull trauma thresholds.  The character can also spend   󲊴   󲊴   to learn its current system strain and hull trauma levels.  Hack  Enemy’s  Systems  Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers check  The character uses computers to attempt to disrupt the systems of an enemy vehicle. If successful,  the character compromises the defenses of the target vehicle for one round per   󲊳   (see the   Vehicle  Components   sidebar, on page   221 ). A   󲊵   may be spent to compromise one enemy weapon of the  character’s choice, and   󲊴   󲊴   may be spent to inflict 1 system strain on the target vehicle.  Intercept  Projectiles  Hard ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers   or  Gunnery check   or   Average  ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Vigilance check  The character tracks incoming attacks and uses vehicle systems to disrupt guided projectiles such  as missiles, or drops flares and chaff at an opportune moment. If the check is successful, any attacks  against their vehicle using weapons with the Guided quality upgrade their difficulty once (plus an  additional upgrade for every additional   󲊳   󲊳 ) until the start of the character's next turn.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 230  Once one pilot gains the advantage, on the follow -  ing turn, the opponent may attempt to cancel out the  advantage by using Gain the Advantage as well. This  works as described earlier, but the difficulty of the  Piloting check is increased by one. After all, it is harder  to maneuver to get on an opponent's tail if that oppo -  nent is already on your tail!  a DD itional   v ehicle   a ctions  Pilot Only:   No  Silhouette:   Any  Speed:   Any  When aboard a vehicle in combat, those who are not  piloting or firing weapons may still want to contrib -  ute to the encounter. Although the number of options  open to them is limited only by a player’s creativity,  Table III.2–17: Additional Vehicle Actions   has a list  of actions passengers can attempt during encounters.  The table lists the actions, the skill required, the check’s  attendant difficulty, and the results of a success. These  actions are all covered by the perform a skill check  action (on page   101 ), and are by no means an exhaus -  tive list—and obviously, not all of these actions are  appropriate for all vehicles or settings, so you should  be sure to use common sense when choosing actions.  However, they do serve to provide a range of ideas.  p erform   a   c ombat   c heck   W ith   v ehicle   W   eapons  Pilot Only:   No  Silhouette:   Any  Speed:   Any  This is similar to the perform a combat check action,  on page   101 , with some minor differences in imple -  mentation due to the differences between vehicles and  individuals. These differences are described below:  •   Each weapon on a vehicle may be fired a maximum  of once per round.  •   Targets must be within the firing arc of the weapon,  as determined by the relative position of vehicles  (and the GM’s discretion).  •   Although the attack difficulty is still based on  the range to the target (see page   102   and   Table  I.6–1: Ranged Attack Difficulties ), vehicle rules  do add the sixth—strategic—range band. Attacks  made at strategic range have a difficulty of   Formi -  dable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) . Also, vehicles have wide vari -  ance in silhouettes, so you should be sure to use the  Size Differences (Silhouettes)   rules on page   109 .  •   Most weapons on vehicles deal damage on planetary  scale, meaning each point of damage is the equiva -  lent of ten points of damage on a personal scale.  •   When a vehicle suffers damage, it reduces that dam -  age by its armor, to a minimum of 0. Any remaining  damage is applied to the vehicle as hull trauma.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 231  v ehicle   c ritical   h its  Vehicles do not suffer Critical Injuries; instead, when  a vehicle would otherwise suffer a Critical Injury due  to   󲊴   or   󲊵   on an attack (or any other effect), it suffers  a Critical Hit instead. Effects that apply to the results  of Critical Injuries, such as the Vicious quality, do not  apply to Critical Hits (and effects that apply to Critical  Hits do not apply to Critical Injuries).  When an attack generates a Critical Hit, the attacker  rolls on   Table III.2–19: Critical Hit Result , on the  previous page, and the target suffers the listed effects.  Critical Hits are divided into four severity levels, which  dictate the difficulty of the check required to repair the  Critical Hit, as listed in the table. These difficulties can  be further modified at your discretion.  Once a vehicle suffers a Critical Hit, it counts as suf -  fering that Critical Hit until it is repaired. This status  counts even if the effects of the Critical Hit only last a  single round. While a vehicle is suffering a Critical Hit,  any additional Critical Hits generated against it add  +10 to the roll on   Table III.2–19: Vehicle Critical Hit  Result   per existing Critical Hit.  Remember that an attack must inflict damage for  the attacker to activate a Critical Hit. Because vehicles  operate on the planetary scale for damage, a hit from  a personal scale weapon must inflict at least 10 dam -  age (1 damage on planetary scale) after reductions for  armor for the attacker to be able to inflict a Critical Hit.  e xample   v ehicles  Although we don’t have the space for a wide variety of  vehicles, we have included a few to give you an idea of  what vehicles look like in   Genesys .  t hree   - m aste D   f ri G ate  Sporting dozens of guns and masts that stretch sixty or  more meters into the sky, these sorts of ships are excel -  lent for fending off marauding pirates, exploring lost  islands, and fighting sea monsters.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 232  h a C king   r ules  D ramatized electronic warfare  is often presented as a sort of  duel between two master technolo -  gists. Although this isn’t how that  works in real life, our game tends to  err on the side of an exciting narrative,  and so for this setting, we’ve provided  some hacking rules that enable this.  e ncounter   s tructure  A full hacking encounter should be  conducted in structured game -  play (see page   95 ). In a hack -  ing encounter, one or more  hackers try to access a system,  override its security programs,  and then do something important in the system—rang -  ing from looping security camera footage and unlocking  electronic doors to stealing sensitive corporate data.  You can create an entire hacking encounter where  the hackers attempt to overcome automated programs  and defenses. However, sometimes the hackers face off  against a living opponent. This systems operator (or  “sysops”) tries to trace the hackers to find out where  they are accessing the system from, then attempts to  lock them out of the system entirely. If the sysops can  lock out the hackers before the hackers accomplish  their goals, the sysops wins.  Since hacking encounters take place in structured  gameplay, you, as the GM, should use the rules for Ini -  tiative (see page 95) to determine the order in which  characters act. Also, since hacking encounters use the  same structured gameplay rules as combat encounters,  you can run a combined hacking and combat encoun -  ter easily, instead of leaving the rest of the party with  nothing to do while the hacker PC gets their time in  the spotlight. You could have the other PCs engaging in  other actions (such as a tense firefight with security or  an attempt to break into a protected building) while the  hacker engages in the hacking encounter. The hacker  can even help their fellows, such as by opening doors to  allow a quick escape or by activating a fire suppression  system right in a security guard’s face.  During a hacking encounter, we call any character  attempting to break into a computer system a “hacker.”  We call a character actively working to protect the sys -  tem a “sysop” (sort for "system operator").  a   l ink   to   the   s ystem  Generally, characters need some sort of link to a com -  puter system to hack it. This involves some sort of hard -  ware (a computer or portable computing device) and a  link into whatever network or Internet your setting has.  It could probably go without saying that hackers and  sysops must both have this link to a system to be able to  hack or protect it. If a character can’t access the system,  they cannot perform any hacking actions or maneuvers  involving that system, and none of their talents or spe -  cial abilities can affect the system.  a ctions  During a hacking encounter, characters can perform a  number of hacking actions to accomplish their goals. We  describe these actions, listing their difficulty, whether  they can be performed by a hacker or sysops (or both),  and providing you with a description of how they work.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 233  a ccess   s ystem  Difficulty:   Computers check (Difficulty Varies)  Available To:   Hacker  Description:   Once the hacker has a direct link to the  system (through a land-line, wireless connection, USB  port, or something more futuristic), they need to access  the system. This action represents the hacker accessing  the system and gaining control over it, so that they can  make the system do what they want later.  As an action, the hacker may make a Computers check  to gain access to the system. The difficulty of the check is  based on the system’s basic security and complexity. See  Table III.2–20: System Security   for suggestions on the  difficulty of breaking into various types of systems.  Once a hacker has successfully accessed a system, they  can use the enact commands maneuver to do things in  the system (what they can do depends on what system  they accessed, of course). However, certain parts of a  system may be further protected by security programs.  The hacker needs to override these security programs  before they can access those parts of a system.  o verri D e   s ecurity   p ro G ram  Difficulty: Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers Check  Available To:   Hacker  Description:   Once a hacker has successfully performed  the access system action, certain parts of a system may still  be protected by security programs. For example, a hacker  may gain access to a facility’s security camera network and  be able to see whatever the security cameras see. However,  the part of the system that controls the cameras is pro -  tected by a security program, which the hacker must over -  ride before they can turn the cameras off.  Each security program has a strength rating. To over -  ride the program, the hacker must make an   Average  ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers check   and generate a number of   󲊳  equal to the program’s rating. If the hacker fails, some -  thing (usually bad) happens, depending on the security  program. We provide three example security programs  on page   235   to use in your hacking encounters.  If the hacker succeeds, the program shuts down, and  cannot be reactivated until the end of the hacker’s next  turn. Hackers can spend   󲊴   or   󲊵   to keep a program shut  down longer, or completely disable it (see page @@).  t race   u ser  Difficulty: Opposed Computers vs Computers check  Available To:   Sysop  Description:   Once the sysops knows that their system is  being hacked, they still need to find out where the hack is  coming from. The more they know about the origin of the  hack, the easier it is to lock the hacker out of their system.  To find out where the hack is coming from, the sys -  ops needs to trace the hacker by performing the trace  user action. The sysops makes   opposed Computers vs  Computers check   targeting the hacker. If successful,  the sysops narrows down the hacker’s location once.  This makes it easier to lock the hacker out of the system  (see the Lockout action), and also provides information  about the hacker’s real-world location. See the Trace  Information sidebar for what a successful trace provides.  Besides making it easy for the sysops to lock the  hacker out of the system, the sysops can also use this  information for other purposes, such as reporting the  hacker to the police (or sending a black-ops team to the  hacker’s house). You can also rule that a sysops needs to  perform the trace user action to learn other key details  about the hacker, such as how to access the hacker’s  computer over the Internet. You can even allow a  hacker to perform the trace user action to learn the  physical location of someone online, such as an enemy  sysops or a rival hacker.  t ra C e   i nfor M ation  A sysop can successfully trace a user up to four  times, each time gaining more information  about the user. Additional traces don’t reveal  any additional information or further decrease  the difficulty of the lockout action, but you can  give the character additional narrative informa -  tion about their opponent for doing so.  Successful traces usually occur via the Trace  User action, but can also happen by spending  󲊴   or   󲊱 , or unsuccessfully attempting to over -  ride a sentry security program.  TABLE III.2–21: TRACE INFORMATION  Traces   Results  1  The sysops learns what country the hacker is  currently in (or its geo-political equivalent,  depending on the setting). The sysops reduces  the difficulty of the lockout action once.  2  The sysops learns what state, province, or region  the hacker is in within that country. The sysops  reduces the difficulty of the lockout action twice.  3  The sysops learns what city or community  the hacker is in (or their location within a  10 kilometer radius). The sysops reduces the  difficulty of the lockout action three times.  4  The sysops learns the address or exact location  of the hacker. The sysops reduces the difficulty of  the lockout action four times. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 234  l ockout  Difficulty: Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Computers check  Available To:   Sysop  Description:   Since the sysops has direct control over the  system, they can lock any users out of the system. As long  as they can find the hacker, they can give them the boot.  Once the sysops is aware of a hacker’s presence, the  sysops may make a   Formidable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) Com -  puters check . If successful, the hacker loses access to  the system. At the GM’s discretion, they may be able to  regain access to the system by performing the Access  System action again. However, at the very least the dif -  ficulty of this action should be increased twice.  Reduce the difficulty of Lockout once for every success -  ful trace against the hacker, to a minimum of   Easy ( 󲊷 ) .  h ackin G   m aneuvers  In a hacking encounter, there are also certain maneuvers  that a character can perform while interacting with a  system. They follow the same format as hacking actions,  but without a difficulty since they don't require a check.  e nact   c omman D  Available To:   Hacker, Sysop  Description:   This maneuver is how characters do things  within a system after they access it. What they can do  with this maneuver could range from looping the foot -  age of specific security cameras in a facility, locking or  unlocking electronic security doors, shutting down  power to an elevator, resetting a drone’s targeting param -  eters, or downloading a cache of corporate information.  Enact command should only let a character perform  a single command in the system (if what a player wants  their character to do is too complex, you can require  them to spend two or more enact command maneuvers  to do it). However, it doesn’t require a check, since once  characters have bypassed security, the system thinks  they’re authorized users (or, if the character is a sysops,  they actually are authorized users).

The difficulty of the Access System action becomes   Easy ( 󲊷 )   as long as the hacker can access the backdoor.  Successful Trace (Sysops Only):   The sysops successfully traces the hacker once (in addition to the other results of the check).  󲊵  Hard Shutdown (Hacker Only):   If the hacker successfully overrode a security program, it is so thoroughly disabled that it cannot be  reactivated for the remainder of the encounter.  Blurred Sig (Hacker Only):   The hacker obscures their signature, canceling one successful trace against them.  Backup Firewall (Sysops Only):   The sysops activates their emergency defensive protocols. A system immediately gains an active backup  firewall with strength 3, protecting one portion of the server chosen by the sysops.  Identified Exploit (Sysops Only):   The sysops spots a backdoor in the system, removing one permanent backdoor of the sysops' choice.  󲊱   or   󲊲   Disorganized System:   The user gets lost in a maze of poorly-named sub-folders. Add   󲊸   to the character's next Computers check in this system.  Online Distractions:   The user gets too focused on the online world. Add   󲊸   󲊸   to any non-Computers checks the user makes next turn.  󲊱   󲊱  or   󲊲  Limited Access (Hacker Only):   The hacker may only perform one hacking action or one hacking maneuver during their next turn.  I Know You! (Hacker Only):   A sysops on the system recognizes the hacker's style. The next time they successfully use the Trace User  action, they successfully trace the hacker one additional time.  Careless Protocols (Sysops Only):   Reduce the strength of one active security program (hacker's choice) by one to a minimum of 1.  󲊱   󲊱   󲊱  or   󲊲  Major Alert (Hacker Only):   All users with access to the system become aware of the presence of an intruder on the network.  Permanent Backdoor (Sysops Only):   As the sysops attempts to lock the system down, they leave a portion vulnerable. The hacker gains a  means of accessing the system without needing to deal with its verification protocols. The difficulty of the Access System action becomes  Easy ( 󲊷 )   as long as the hacker can access the backdoor.  󲊲  Successful Trace (Hacker Only):   Sloppy work allows one sysops on the system to successfully trace the hacker once.  Wrong Person (Sysops Only):   As the sysops traces the hacker, they get one crucial element of the hacker's identity completely wrong.  This does not remove a successful trace, but it does mean that they may have the wrong name, apartment number, or exact location of  the hacker, which guarantees the hacker avoids any real-world retaliation and probably embarrasses the sysops in front of their superiors. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 235  Characters can only perform this maneuver after they  have successfully performed the Access System action  and gained access to the computer system. Also, remem -  ber that some parts of a system may be protected behind  firewalls, which must be overridden before the character  can enact commands that affect that part of the system.  a ctivate   p ro G rams  Available To:   Hacker, Sysop  Description:   Characters use this maneuver to activate  (or reactivate) security programs, as well as any other  programs that help or hinder hacking that you may  have created for your setting.  s ecurity   p ro G rams  Security programs are static defenses that keep users  from running amok on a computer system. You, the  GM, get to decide how many security programs a system  has, but keep in mind that only the most secure system  would have more than a few such programs active at any  given time due to the load they put on the system.  We’ve provided three example security programs  (and a forth that isn’t really a security program). This  should be enough for you to run basic hacking encoun -  ters, and also give you an idea for how to design your  own   security   programs.   Each   program   includes   a  strength , which is how many   󲊳   a character needs to  get on the override security program action to disable  it. It also has an   effect , which is what happens to a char -  acter if they fail their attempt to override the security  program. If they succeed, the program deactivates until  the end of the hacker’s next turn.  When designing your own security programs, we  recommend not making a strength higher than 5, as  this is very hard to overcome.  f ire W all  Firewalls are effectively barriers in cyberspace that  limit access to certain parts of a server or system. If a  user tries to penetrate them and fails, they get bumped  back to the main system.  Program Strength:   3  Effects:   If a character attempts to override this program  and fails, they are unable to access the portion of the  server the firewall protects (there are no further effects).  s entry  Sentries don’t stop you from accessing restricted parts  of a server. However, they spot unauthorized access  and attempt to trace the offender.  Program Strength:   2  Effects:   If a character attempts to override this program  and fails, the sysops or other system administrators are  immediately notified of the intrusion. In addition, the  sentry provides any sysops or system administrators  who access the system during the encounter one suc -  cessful trace against the hacker.  G   ate  Gates are authentication programs. If a user has the right  credentials (or can override the system to make it think  they do), they let the user pass. If the user does not, the  program automatically boots them from the system.  Program Strength:   2  Effects:   If a character attempts to override this program  and fails, they immediately lose access to the entire sys -  tem, and must perform the Access System action again.  G   ate   ( p op   -   up   )  This version of a gate is universally reviled marketing  gimmick, not a true security program. It won’t stop  access to a server, but it is annoying.  Program Strength:   1  Effects:   If a character attempts to override this pro -  gram and fails, they suffer 2 strain. They may also feel a  fleeting compulsion to buy a new vehicle or invest in a  suspect weight-loss plan.  s pen D in G   󲊴 ,   󲊱 ,   󲊵 ,   an D   󲊲  When a hacker’s check results in   󲊴 ,   󲊱 ,   󲊵 , or   󲊲 , these  symbols may be spent narratively as usual.

We’ve already discussed the first type of opposition, in  the form of the difficulty to access the system and the  existence of any security programs. The difficulty to  break into a system can run from   Simple (–)   to   Formi -  dable ( 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ) , and we’ve provided some exam -  ples in   Table III.2–20: System Security , on page   232 .  Preparing NPC opposition for hacking encounters  works in largely the same manner as preparing NPCs  for any other purpose. However, if the PCs are unlikely  to encounter the sysops in person, then you only need  to know the characteristics that are relevant for the  sysops' role in the encounter. Providing the foe’s Intel -  lect characteristic and Computers skill can often be  enough, unless you expect the PCs to later encounter  that character in the flesh. Giving the NPC talents like  Defensive Sysops can help an especially talented enemy  stand out. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 236  CHAPTER 3: BUILD AN ADVENTURE  T he adventure is the central element of a roleplaying  game session. It encapsulates the backdrop, obsta -  cles, enemies, and plot in an organized fashion. This  helps you keep gameplay moving by reducing the need  to come up with every story element or search for just  the right enemy stat block on the spot at the table.  There are different levels of adventure preparation.  Let’s talk about them.  Published adventures contain everything you need  to run a particular story. They contain the plot, text  you can read aloud to your players, maps, illustrations,  detailed breakdowns of the encounters, and most of  the stat blocks for characters the PCs interact with or  battle against. You adapt the story to your specific game  as much or as little as needed. A published adventure  can’t meet the needs of an infinite variety of PCs, but  you can adapt it to better match your party’s abilities.  Highly   prepared   adventures   approach   the   level  of detail in published adventures. You develop the  story, create the majority of the characters, note some  read-aloud text for important scenes, and gather all  the rules-related material and stat blocks. You have a  good idea of where you want the plot to go, and how  to adapt the adventure to player character surprises. It  takes time to prepare, and many Game Masters enjoy  assembling the elements.  Covering-the-basics preparation is exactly what it  says. You pull together just enough information to get  you through a game session or adventure. You jot down  some notes regarding your plans for a plot. You cre -  ate or bookmark existing stat blocks for your NPCs.  You probably sketch rough maps for the most critical  scenes. Everything else you deal with as it comes up  during the game. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 237  Sometimes, you don’t have enough time to prepare  before the game, or your players go so far afield that the  prepared adventure isn’t going to cut it. You must rely on  your own storytelling skills, as well as the narrative dice  and the players’ imaginations, to keep the storyline mov -  ing. While this is true of every roleplaying game session, in  this case, you don’t have time to develop a lot of subplots  or completely think through the consequences of NPCs’ or  PCs’ actions. This is not necessarily a bad thing, and many  gaming groups use this style of play almost exclusively.  Use whichever level of preparation you are comfort -  able with. When you are first learning how to be a Game  Master, using published adventures gives you everything  you need for story and stats. This leaves you free to con -  centrate on running the game and adjudicating the rules.  As you develop your skills as a Game Master, you’ll likely  become more comfortable with prepping less.  W here   D o   y ou   s tart ?  There are two primary elements to creating an adventure:  developing a story and assembling mechanically suitable  encounters that achieve your narrative goals. You typi -  cally start with the story, then assemble the encounters.  Sources for story inspiration can come from any -  where:   novels,   television,   movies,   other   games,  moments in history, or current events. You are not and  should not be the sole source of story ideas for your  gaming group. The players should have plenty of ideas  about the characters they want to play and the sort of  adventures they would like to participate in. Their story  ideas can provide a great starting point. This section  covers some concepts to help inspire you.  s ettin G   the   t one  First, select your game’s genre, setting, and tone (see  Part II   for example settings). A high magic fantasy  game has different elements and expectations than a  modern day political thriller. While elements of one  can certainly be used in the other, and cross-genre  mashup stories are popular in fiction, a genre’s defining  elements point to types of adventures that are a good fit  for your game. In the Narrative Dice System, tones take  place within settings. Some settings may be compatible  with multiple tones, allowing you to use different tones  in different adventures. See   Part III–Chapter 4: Tones ,  on page   241 , for more information.  s tory   c oncepts  Adventures feature a specific goal or endgame for the  player characters to achieve or experience. As you cre -  ate your adventure, use this to drive the core storyline,  and continue to support this ultimate story destination,  even if the PCs’ actual path varies from the original  plan (and it will).  Each adventure features several types of conflict. Dra -  matic clashes between characters form the basis of social  encounters. Fighting and combat provide action and  danger. Calculated puzzles and challenging natural envi -  ronments engage problem-solving skills. Mix and match  these elements to create a variety of scenes and events.  Adventures support classic narrative concepts found  in all types of stories:  •   Person vs. Person:   A   specific   person   actively  opposes the PCs’ actions and goals.  •   Person vs. Society:   The PCs are fighting to change  an established society’s evils or oppressive norms.  •   Person vs. Nature:   The PCs struggle in an inhospi -  table landscape or a natural disaster.  •   Person vs. Self:   This is more commonly used by  a single PC to define their character actions and  traits for roleplaying and story elements within  a larger adventure. However, it is also possible to  have a party full of characters who each have their  own personal conflicts to resolve.  •   Person vs. Technology:   The PCs work against a  form of advanced technology that threatens to take  over their lives or wields power over them.  •   Person vs. Supernatural:   The PCs oppose strange  and dangerous creatures (or effects) that usually  wield powerful magic-like abilities and break all  natural laws that limit mortal individuals.  If you find yourself struggling to develop an initial idea,  consider using one of the above conflicts to develop a  basic adventure framework. Select one of these concepts  to establish the PCs’ ultimate opposing force, and pick one  or two others that could serve as a subplot in the story.  t he   pc s   versus   the   b i G   b a D   v illain  Many adventures feature a fight against an ultimate  bad guy. It could be an evil monarch, mad scientist,  rogue religious leader, despotic feudal lord, or even a  malevolent computer. In these adventures, the villain  is the ultimate linchpin whose defeat will radically  change the current circumstances for the better. These  adventures are typically person vs. person affairs, but  they can easily cross over into person vs. technology or  person vs. supernatural, depending on the exact villain.  t he   pc s   versus   the   v ery   D   an G erous   e nvironment  This concept embodies the earliest roleplaying game  environment: the dungeon. Your party is out to defeat Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 238  the elements of the dungeon, whether they are natural  dangers or ones designed by a cunning, mad wizard  as wards guarding a tomb. While there are likely liv -  ing opponents along the way, they typically serve as  obstacles to overcome rather than as an ultimate enemy.  The dungeon concept is easily adapted to adventuring  activities in other environs with similar elements, such  as investigating a derelict starship, sneaking into a high-  security high-rise, or attacking a military base in any  technological era.  t he   pc s   versus   the   n efarious   pc s  In games of high political or personal intrigue, the PCs  themselves might actively work with and oppose each  other at different times within the story. While this is  usually a form of person vs. person, from a party point  of view, it can be conceived of as person vs. self. A clas -  sic example of this type of adventure features agents  of opposing governments who are forced to work  together for a common goal, but are expected to fight  for an opposing goal that manifests immediately after  they achieve the common goal as a team.  s tories   an D   G   oals  Each adventure needs an ultimate goal, and the PCs  should learn what that is almost immediately. Nor -  mally, this occurs in an introduction or during the  opening scene. While achieving the goal may involve  mysteries and complications along the way, the players  need to have a clear direction to keep them motivated  and on track. If the players know or learn too little,  they’re more likely to go in the wrong direction or sim -  ply become frustrated.  Common plotlines include variations and combina -  tions of the following:  •   The PCs search for something important (or at  least important to them) in one area or across mul -  tiple locations.  •   The PCs must fight a dangerous or superior force to  defend themselves or others important to them.  •   The PCs become embroiled in an investigation to  expose a hidden threat or to reveal criminal activity.  •   The PCs must protect an item or individual from  attack, theft, or other threat.  Ask the question “What if this happened?” to create  theoretical circumstances that the player characters or  other inhabitants of the game world must respond to or  confront. Use the hows, whys, and whos to generate the  plot and encounters.  c haracters  Adventures feature a multitude of non-player characters.  They help make the game world feel inhabited, and they  add to the tone or flavor of the scene. Minor NPCs typically  don’t have names or a large impact on the story. Recurring  characters usually have names and recognizable features,  and are significant threats or allies. Major NPCs have all  the aspects of recurring characters, plus developed back -  grounds that tie into the events of the adventure.  Every adventure should have at least a couple of major  NPCs, even if they are not an enemy to be defeated.  Major and recurring NPCs need memorable elements,  such as a specific attitude, style of dress, signature device,  or recognizable vehicle. Depending on your comfort  level with improvisation and voice acting, you might  also speak in certain ways or accents. If you’re not com -  fortable with this kind of informal performance, you can  always just add those elements to the NPC’s description  that you give to your players.  l ocations   an D   s cenes  The adventure’s events must take place somewhere,  the more interesting the better. That’s not to say every  single location has to be highly detailed, as those are  best used for major scenes. Exciting locations make for  memorable scenes and inspire player creativity.  When setting a scene, picture it as you might in a  movie or while reading a novel. How bright is it? Are  there multiple levels? Balconies? Pools or rivers? Dan -  gerous machinery? Does it change configuration some -  how? How many people are there and why? Are there  specific noises? What’s the weather like?  w hat   i f   t his   h appened ?  “What if there were a town where each night an  entire building disappeared?” The answers lead  to very different types of adventures:  •   The buildings are teleported to another  realm or dimension.  •   The buildings dissolve, leaving the peo -  ple inside behind. Or not.  •   The earth swallows them without warning.  •   Swarms of nanites reconfigure the build -  ings   overnight,   sometimes   completely  removing one to add to others.  •   A local child has a supernatural ability to  make “scary” buildings “go away.” Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

Most locations don’t require a lot of detail to get the  idea across. A straightforward description, especially  of typical locales, is often all you need. However, a map  helps to describe highly unusual or complicated areas. In  some types of adventures, creating a map ahead of time  is critical to the story: for example, when the PCs must  search a labyrinthine starship, or set up castle defenses  against an invading army. Treasure maps, deck plans,  skirmish zones, technical schematics, and similar map  variations can also add a lot of flavor to a game.  C onstru C ting   e n C ounters  O nce you know what types of social and combat  encounters you need for the adventure, you can  turn to building them in game mechanics terms. First,  decide your desired encounter difficulty. Is it a brief  scene that the PCs are expected to breeze through  with low risk? Is it threatening but probably not dev -  astating if things go badly? Is it a climactic scene with  difficult odds?  The following elements contribute to an encounter’s  difficulty. Manipulate the difficulty of each to pro -  duce the strength of challenge you are aiming  for. The more obstacles the PCs have to  overcome, the more difficult the encounter.  In   most   encounters,   the   majority   of  the difficulty comes from the PCs’ direct  opponents. That makes the numbers and  mix of minions, rivals, and nemeses the  most important factor to consider from  a game mechanics point of view. If you  want defeating the main nemesis villain  to be the focus, be careful about how  many other elements directly affect the  PCs. For example, you might want to have  one hundred minions running around to  serve the story needs, but to only include a  few in your calculations, as the rest probably  have problems to deal with other  than threatening the PCs.  l etting   the   n arrative   d i C e   d rive   the   n arrative  Most Game Masters love storytelling and creating  their own tales. In an RPG, there is always inter -  play between the GM and players as to how much  each contributes to the story. Some GMs work hard  to keep their players within their pre-planned plot.  This is fine if the players have fun and like that style  of play, but too much of this is known as railroad -  ing. Usually the players feel more invested when  they get to contribute to the story as well.  Genesys   encourages creative actions as a result of  the dice pool rolls. The interpretation of   󲊴 ,   󲊵 ,   󲊱 ,  and   󲊲   can take the scene in unexpected directions  when coupled with spur-of-the-moment ideas. As a  feature of the game system, you and the players are  encouraged to allow the dice to influence the story.  An unexpected twist during an encounter can pro -  vide a brief moment of fun—or if it affects a criti -  cal character or plot point, it could have a dramatic  effect on the whole story.  If you want to take advantage of this, be willing  to let your players come up with their own ways  to spend   󲊴 ,   󲊵 ,   󲊱 , and   󲊲 . This gives them more  ownership of the story. Also, spend a few min -  utes ahead of time noting specific effects that only  occur on certain dice results, and link them to your  planned plot. Having them ready ahead of time can  keep your story on track but let your players feel  like they discovered something special. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 240  e stablishin G   a D versary   D   ifficulty  Adversaries in combat encounters consist of min -  ions, rivals, and nemeses (see   Adversaries , on page  131 , and   Create an Adversary , on page   202 ). Most  encounters do not include all three types, with nem -  eses appearing at critical story moments. Rivals are  used as moderately challenging opponents for the  PCs in most encounters, while minions exist to bulk  out encounters with easy foes.  Use the following guidelines to help establish the  strength of adversaries in an encounter:  •   Individual Challenging Opponent:   The adver -  sary (usually a rival or nemesis) should have attack  skills and defenses comparable to or slightly higher  than the PCs’ skills and defenses. They can also  have a wound threshold twice as high as an indi -  vidual PC.  •   If the PCs Are Outnumbered:   Use rivals and/or  minions with combat skills and defenses that are  one or two Ability dice or points lower than the  PCs’ skills and defenses.  •   For Advanced PCs:   Increase the combat skills of the  NPCs, add one or more minion groups or rivals to  the encounter, or increase NPC wound thresholds.  These are common encounter setups for a group of  four PCs:  •   Four minions acting individually.   This is a good  first encounter for brand-new players.  •   Two groups of minions   (three or four each).  •   One rival with one group of four minions.  •   Three rivals.   This is a moderately difficult encounter.  •   One nemesis with two groups of minions   (three  or four each). This is a difficult encounter.  •   One nemesis, one rival, and one group of five  minions.   This is also a difficult encounter.  m echanical   b reak D o W n :   a D venture   b uil D in G  From a game mechanics standpoint, building an adven -  ture is a matter of PC resource management—usually  wounds and strain taken (although this can also include  using scarce resources in a post-apocalyptic adventure,  or recovering from fear in a horror story).  Each encounter expends PC resources. When the  resources are easily renewable, the players typically take  on more encounters before worrying too much about  stopping for rest or recovery time. Combat encounters  in particular can be difficult to recover from when a lot  of wounds and Critical Injuries are involved.  As you build your adventure, you can use this expen -  diture to help create tension within the story. Encounters  that occur in rapid succession without time for recovery  can build tension and stress in the following encounters.  The characters must get more creative to work around  their limited resources. However, they can easily become  frustrated if this occurs too often in the game.  h o W   m any   e ncounters   ?  How many encounters should your adventure include?  If you’re playing regularly and aren’t overly concerned  about the time each encounter takes, use however many  you need to tell the story. However, if you have a limited  time to play—say just a few hours or a few sessions—  you’ll need more precision in the number of encounters  and encounter length. Remember that there are various  types of encounters, including social and exploration,  not just combat. Mix them throughout the adventure.  A complete one-session adventure works well with two  major encounters and two or three quicker encounters.  A longer adventure typically has six to nine encounters,  with three or four major scenes. Keep in mind that the  longer the adventure, the more likely the PCs are to move  the story in unintended directions, especially if everyone  gets creative with the dice pool results! For longer adven -  tures, try setting up specific encounters for major events  and allowing the PCs more leeway in a sandbox-style  environment for traversing those in between.

Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

CHAPTER 4: TONES  N ow, let’s talk about another element of adven -  tures—the tone. While a setting provides inspira -  tion for the location, era, and types of characters in a  game, the tone you select creates an attitude and style  that informs how the players will play their characters  and what they can expect out of the game. A game  using the pulp tone, for example, would likely feature  some laughter and humor, along with fast-paced action  and a clear line between good and evil. Players in mys -  tery games would get double-crosses and gray shades  of morality, and they would expect to spend a lot of  time trying to solve puzzles.  Our system includes tones ranging from pulp to hor -  ror and from mystery to romance, with lots in between.  In the pages that follow, each tone gets its own section,  where you’ll find what it can offer to your game, its  common themes, and tips for using it in your game.  Many of these sections also include new rules for situ -  ations that can come into play when using a particular  tone, such as sanity and fear rules for horror games.  u sin G   t ones  Most games need a tone to set the mood and outlook for  the game. It’s very important to remember that there is  no “right” tone for each setting, though—any tone can  be used in any setting. Indeed, one way to create memo -  rable games is to apply a tone in a setting  where it seems unusual. For exam -  ple, a weird war setting would  normally   inspire   horror,   so  a romance tone here could  create unique adventures.  You also don’t need to  stick with just one tone.  Combining   them   can  create beautiful music  in a game, as has  been demonstrated many times in movies. This can  be done by alternating them (horror punctuated with  romance is a common mix), or mixing them into a blend  (such as superheroes attempting to solve a mystery).  Tones can do more than just establish moods and  characterizations. They can also illustrate aspects of a  setting that might not normally be displayed. A mod -  ern horror game might illustrate how our world isn’t as  rational as we thought, and in fantasy, that tone could  reveal the darkness in an often morally simple setting.  Like almost everything else in running a successful  roleplaying game, it is essential that you not only dis -  cuss with your players the major tone or tones planned  for the campaign, but also ensure that everyone agrees  on what they mean. For example, for a horror game,  make sure the players know what kinds of frights could  occur. This doesn’t mean revealing details, but perhaps  saying it will feature supernatural possession, lots of  gore, or intense real-world terrors, and then determin -  ing how everyone feels about that. If any players have  issues with any aspects, discuss and change things as  needed. Prep work like this for using tones is essential  for an enjoyable game, so don’t skimp on it! Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 242  h orror  S o, you want to scare some people? Excellent! Hor -  ror-themed games can be great fun. In this section,  we’ll talk about the horror tone, what it means, and  what it can offer in the way of adventure ideas, themes,  and tips for horror games. You’ll also find rules for  fear and sanity, allowing you to represent the mental  trauma that horror can cause.  First, let’s talk about horror itself. At its core, horror  is what inspires fear—but not just any fear. There is the  fear of flunking a test or missing a flight, and then there  is the fear of a monster eating you or of losing your soul.  It’s the latter that this tone is about: characters facing  extraordinary dangers outside their experience, control,  or understanding. Ones that can kill them—or worse.  The “or worse” is often a primary part of horror, and  often an easy death might be a character’s best choice.  W hy   u se   h orror ?  This all sounds pretty grim, so why use it in a game?  Simply put, most people enjoy being scared. More pre -  cisely, they enjoy it in a controlled manner. Like riding  roller coasters and seeing monster movies, facing fear -  some situations and “surviving” can be an exhilarating  experience when there is no real danger. In this aspect,  roleplaying games are perfect for horror: the players  surrender control over their environment (and often  their characters), suspend disbelief, and willingly enter  the story you create and control. Loss of control is a  major theme in horror.  Horror can also introduce elements to other games,  such as tension. It can twist player expectations, turn -  ing a mundane investigation in supernatural direc -  tions, for example. Horror can transform the very set -  ting, revealing layers of reality beyond normal life or  the hidden secrets Humanity Was Not Meant to Know.  t hemes   in   h orror  Let’s talk about some types of horror that can apply to  games. The most common is the supernatural, such as  ghostly hauntings or demonic possession. These often  defy science or employ it in unusual fashion, and real -  ity itself might become unreliable. On the opposite end  of the spectrum is psychological or realistic horror in  which daily threats grow to hideous proportions, like  a brilliant and depraved serial killer. The environment  itself might be the threat, where the surroundings are  out of control and trying to consume you.  These are all external horrors, while body horror  concerning your own physical form and how it is no  longer under your control is perhaps the strongest  form of internal horror. Madness and corruption are  two other internal horrors, loss of sanity and loss of  purity (or even loss of your soul) being the threats the  players must overcome.  Another thing to consider when using horror is  how overt or subtle to make it. Grotesque horrors like  dismembered corpses or alien parasites can certainly  strengthen the mood of a horror adventure, but too  much gore can also become laughable. The unknown  waiting in the shadows or behind a door, out of sight  but still dangerous, can be very effective in build -  ing tension. Often just the sounds an unseen creature  makes or the stench that accompanies it is more effec -  tive in generating fear than is its actual appearance.  r eal   vs .   f un   h orror  Keep in mind that horror can be upsetting if  used improperly. Some players might have seri -  ous phobias, or dislike heavy gore or references  to the real-world horrors of war, genocide, or  abuse. Player ages should also be a factor here;  some types of horror are not appropriate for  all ages, after all. Keeping your monsters more  on the fantastical side is a good way to ensure  this doesn’t happen, but as always when using  a tone, talk to your players to ensure your plans  jibe with their expectations—they might actu -  ally want a serious affair linking to real horrors.  At the end of the day (or end of the world), hor -  ror adventures should be a tension-filled but  fun experience for everyone! They found Paulie exactly where the encrypted  message said he would be, shackled in a hologuised  room, but his back was carved with odd, freshly drip -  ping icons that looked like a neural net diagram.  When he said it was Kale who had imprisoned him,  they grew still. They remembered months ago when  they had stopped her from stealing some bleeding-  edge corp tech. Stopped her with a hail of flechette  fire, and watched her die screaming for revenge. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 243  r unnin G   h orror   - t heme D   G   ames  Possibly the most important aspect when using the  horror tone is pacing, as an adventure filled with noth -  ing but tension and terror can soon lead to diminishing  returns for fright. Weaving in lighter moments, even  using comedy, can help refresh things. Think of a hor -  ror adventure like a roller coaster: you want to punc -  tuate the scary falls and turns with calmer periods,  allowing players to catch their breath, laugh a little, and  ready themselves for the next fright.  This also helps sustain the overall mood, because play -  ers without a natural time to make jokes will find them -  selves doing so in moments designed for dread. (That  being said, a monster popping out in a lighter moment  can nicely show them that they are never safe—often a  key point in a horror game.) Suspension of disbelief and  buy-in on the premise of the horror are important to  monitor, perhaps more so than for other tones. You can  encourage this with audio representing the characters’  surroundings and handouts that feel “in-universe.”  Creating this universe and its horrors is another  aspect to consider. Will you use an existing mythos  and monsters (which might be easier to fashion, but  players might know quite well), or will you create new  ones (probably more work, but also a fresh experience  for your group)? Are your horrors ones the PCs can  defeat and comprehend, or are they ones that can only  be staved off for a time? What can these perils do to  your PCs, as mere death could be too prosaic? As they  learn of and face these horrors, how might characters  grow from life to death (and possibly undeath) in the  campaign? These are all things you should establish for  yourself, with the PCs possibly learning them as well in  their adventures.  A last important note on running these games is that  horror is relative. It should always be seriously threaten -  ing, but given the setting, the specifics will vary. An attack -  ing orc won’t frighten a group of seasoned fantasy adven -  turers, for example, but could send modern characters  running in terror (and the reverse in the case of a flame-  throwing tank). No matter the specifics, horror should  also always be fresh and something new to the characters,  or at a level beyond anything they have seen before. Famil -  iarity ruins fear, and horror should always be exciting!  n e W   r ules   :   f ear  Although the circumstances in a horror game may be  scary to your players, they should be far more horrify -  ing for your players’ characters. (After all, the charac -  ters don’t have the luxury of knowing that it’s all only  a game!) To represent this—and also recognize that  some characters are braver than others—you can add  the fear rules to your game.  When characters in your game confront something  that you feel may be terrifying to them, you can have  them make a Discipline skill check. We sometimes call  this a   fear check .  As the GM, you set the difficulty of the check. You can  use   Table III.4–1: Fear Guidelines   to help figure out  how difficult a check should be and what circumstances  might elicit a fear check from your PCs in the first place.  Typically, once a character has rolled a fear check for a  specific set of circumstances, you shouldn’t require them  to check again for the same circumstances during the  same encounter. Remember that if the circumstances  relate to the character’s Fear motivation (see page   48 ),  you’ll want to add the appropriate penalties to the check!  e ffects   of   f ear  In the list below, we’ve provided some mechanical  effects for failing fear checks (and succeeding on them  as well). Of course, you can also add narrative effects to  a check, depending on the circumstances.  Suggested effects for failing or generating   󲊱   or   󲊲 :  •   Aversion:   The character is unnerved and dis -  tracted, and is disoriented for the rest of the  encounter. This is a good penalty for simple failure.  TABLE III.4–1: FEAR GUIDELINES  State of Fear   Difficulty   Example  Startled   Easy ( π )   Something momentarily frightening, such as someone leaping out of a closet to surprise you, or unsettling  circumstances like being alone in a spooky house. These circumstances may not even elicit a check.  Moderately Afraid   Average ( π   π )   Confronting something unexplainable, such as furniture that moves when you're not looking or voices in an empty  house; being stalked by a dangerous animal; danger that appears credible but not mortal.  Very Afraid   Hard ( π   π   π )   Ghostly apparitions and other obviously supernatural occurrences, being hunted by a pack of wild animals  (or malevolent humans), danger that appears eminent and could be mortal.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 244  •   Adrenaline Rush:   Momentary panic gives the  character a rush of adrenalin, but at a cost. The  character adds   󲊸   to their next check, but suffers  3 strain. This a good penalty for success with   󲊱 .  •   Flee in Terror:   The character has to spend their next  turn doing nothing but fleeing the source of the fear  check (this includes downgrading their actions to  maneuvers to move farther away). This is a good  penalty for failure with a small amount of   󲊱   or a   󲊲 .  •   Frozen in Terror:   The character is immobilized and  staggered during their next turn. This is a good pen -  alty for failure with a lot of   󲊱   or   󲊲 .  Suggested effects for succeeding or generating   󲊴   or   󲊵 :  •   Steady Nerves:   The character keeps their nerve  and suffers no ill effects. Obviously, this is a good  result for passing their fear check.  •   Stand with Me:   The character’s steadfast response  emboldens their allies. Any allied characters forced  to make a fear check from the same source add   󲊸  to their check. This is a good result for passing a  fear check with   󲊴 .  •   Fearless:   The character faces the source of fear and  finds that it no longer has a hold on them. They  automatically pass any further fear checks from that  source. This is a good result for succeeding with   󲊵 ,  but you should not apply these results if the source  is the character’s Fear motivation (see page   48 ).  n e W   r ules   :   s anity  Just as fear is an integral part of horror, failure to over -  come fear leads to insanity—especially given the types  of fearsome threats characters face. These new rules can  be used when a character fails a fear check particularly  badly, to represent the ongoing effects of mental trauma  that hinder the ability to act in rational manner. Note that  all of the normal effects from fear checks still apply, but  are now just the tip of the iceberg as sanity slips away…  Whenever   a   PC   fails   a   fear   check   with   󲊲   or  󲊱   󲊱   󲊱   󲊱   󲊱 , they also suffer a mental trauma. The  trauma’s severity should be the same as the difficulty  of the fear check, although you may select a different  trauma or modify the description of the trauma based  on the actual fear-causing event. At your discretion, you  can also apply a trauma when a character undergoes  a particularly stressful encounter that results in them  exceeding their strain threshold and falling uncon -  scious. In this case, the exact trauma is up to you, but it  should relate in some way to what caused the strain and  to the intensity of the encounter. A near-lethal combat  encounter, for example, might lead to a Phobia linked  to bloodshed. Should a character gain the same trauma  as one they already possess, they gain a trauma one  severity level higher instead.  󲊵   on a successful fear check can be spent to remove  one mental trauma that has an associated severity level  that is the same as or less than the difficulty of the fear  check. (For example, a successful   Hard [ 󲊷   󲊷   󲊷 ] fear  check   with   󲊵   could be used to remove a single Delu -  sion, Phobia, or Obsession.) With your permission,  traumas might also be removed (perhaps temporarily)  via other methods such as intense meditation, therapy,  medication, or similar means.  You and the player should determine the specif -  ics concerning the character’s trauma based on the  encounter that created the trauma, and work this into  the character’s behavior. After all, these traumas should  be as much roleplaying prompts as they are mechani -  cal effects. In addition, while a character suffers from  one of these traumas, you can spend   󲊱   and   󲊲   from  any checks they make to add additional effects to their  growing insanity. You can also invent similar effects  based off the ones described here.  TABLE III.4–2: TRAUMAS AND THEIR EFFECTS  Severity   Trauma   Impact on the Character  Easy ( π )   Obsession  You can spend   󲊱   and   󲊲   the character generates to represent their obsession affecting their ability to interact with others.  󲊱   󲊱 : Add   󲊸   to the character's social skill checks for the remainder of the encounter.  󲊲 : Increase the difficulty of all of the character's social skill checks by one for the remainder of the encounter.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 245  i ntrigue  D o your players like matching wits with you or other  players? Do their characters like gaming a setting’s  social or governmental systems? Do they like outwardly  pursuing one goal, but following ulterior motives? They  may like intrigue-focused adventures.  Intrigues   feature   politics,   underhanded   dealings,  betrayals,   and   shifting   alliances.   They   encourage  roleplaying and character background development.  Detailed backgrounds provide deeper story connec -  tions. Political conflicts range from personal battles  within a small group to political maneuvers that can  change the world.  W hy   u se   i ntri G ue ?  Intrigue adventures use information manipulation and  secrets to inject twists and suspense into the story. Char -  acters have to use investigative skills, persuasive abilities,  deductive reasoning, deal making, and diplomacy to  defeat their foes when violence isn’t an alternative.  Intrigue-focused adventures engage different levels of  the setting’s society or political intensity. Circumstances  can force even relatively inexperienced characters into  events of national consequence. The characters swept  along with great events might fight to guide or survive  them. Intrigue-focused adventures let the players take  the lead in their characters’ story development. They will  actively drive the story to meet their goal, creating plans  and taking actions toward their ultimate ends.  t hemes   of   i ntri G ue  Intrigue-themed adventures differ based on the politics  involved. The intrigue of a royal court is going to play  out differently than conflicts between criminal syn -  dicates. Intrigue-focused conflicts are defined by the  societal expectations and laws that govern the circum -  stances, as well as by how and when those rules are bro -  ken. Political gamesmanship requires the characters to  understand how far they may bend and stretch societal  rules before the backlash hinders their plans.  Small-group intrigue focuses on interpersonal rival -  ries. It features risks and consequences that are important  to the group, but mean little to anyone else. Examples  include poor families, groups isolated from civilization,  competing small businesses, and groups of friends.  Criminal intrigue features illegal dealings. The groups  involved range from rival gangs and competing criminal  syndicates to powerful cartels that threaten levels of gov -  ernment. Criminal intrigue involves at least three lev -  els of intrigue. One concerns a character’s relationship  with their immediate associates and boss. The second  concerns the character’s reputation among the general  public. The third concerns the character’s relationship to  law enforcement. When your players have to consider all  three levels at once before taking any action, intrigue and  social manipulation become their default tool.  Noble intrigue focuses on the workings of a particular  royal court, where one individual or family holds consid -  erable power over everyone else. The politics may include  other nobles and rival governments. Everyone involved  in the court has their own agenda and goal, and knows  how much they’re willing to risk to win. Their limits  range from social embarrassment to murder. Noble-style  politics also work for organizations such as corporations.  Political intrigue is similar to noble intrigue. However,  if the political system resembles most modern political  systems, you can add different departments jockeying for  influence, reporters digging for a story, and the public per -  ception of events to your game. Generally, political intrigue  has characters working within a system to accomplish their  goals. If they try to do something illicit or illegal, they risk  discovery and destruction in the public eye.  r unnin G   i ntri G ue   - t heme D   G   ames  What your PCs know about the people they interact  with is the focus of a game with a tone of intrigue.  Motivations and backgrounds are very important, as  these provide potential levers for your PCs to discover  and use to manipulate an opponent.  The adventure needs a difficult goal, requiring some  cooperation between PC and NPC rivals and oppo -  nents. The PCs must have an initial idea of how to  accomplish this ultimate goal, but not the means. They  must make discoveries, negotiate deals, and find ways  to get others to reveal vital information. There should  never be only one way to achieve the goal. The Queen got us and the Chancellor’s self-incrim -  inating letter into the King’s war room. We proudly  displayed the evidence. Silence. The King declared the  letter his master plan to reveal enemy spies and said  our interception had destroyed it. Worse, he ordered  us and the Queen arrested for taking the letter from a  diplomatically protected pouch. As we were led away,  his smile told us more—it was a trap set for us, not  any spy. The Queen’s faction couldn’t stop him now. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 246  When   you   build   an   intrigue-focused   adventure,  make sure you add different layers of intrigue. When  your players discover important secrets, they should  also unlock new opportunities. They should be shocked  or horrified to discover allies that are actually enemies,  and suffer betrayals of trust. The following are some  possible points of intrigue. You should review them,  and add at least one to every major NPC and organiza -  tion in your adventure.  p oints   of   i ntri G ue  •   The character’s current position, its stability, and  the character’s desired position.  •   The character’s visible weaknesses, such as gam -  bling or bad temperament.  •   The character’s secret weaknesses, such as vices,  connections, or mistakes from their past. Maybe the  character doesn’t even know about this weakness!  •   The character’s visible strengths that can be used  against rivals.  •   The character’s hidden strengths that could sur -  prise the PCs and derail their plans.  •   Who are the character’s allies, underlings, and oppo -  nents? Are they vulnerable to PC manipulation?  •   How far will this character go to get what they  want? Every character should have limits, and most  shouldn’t want to violate the law or societal norms.  •   Who are the character’s relatives and friends, and  how strong is the bond between them?  Major revelations are key moments. Plan them like  you would a major combat or critical social encounter.  While you can’t control what the PCs reveal, you can  set up what they learn. Given that the players might not  immediately put two and two together in the midst of  the game, consider having a few notes prepared ahead of  time. You can hand them out, pointing out connections  that they may not immediately think of, but that their  characters would. Overuse of this method takes away  some of the fun of working things out for themselves.  n e W   r ules   :   m ajor   r evelation  When a major revelation appears, you can use this rule  to see if your PCs recognize how important it is.  One PC should make an   Average ( 󲊷   󲊷 ) Knowledge,  Negotiation,   or   Perception check,   depending on what  best fits the situation. If this check is successful, the  PC sees a way to use the revelation to their advantage,  and the group upgrades the ability of checks related to  that revelation until the end of the session. If they fail,  they misread the situation and upgrade the difficulty of  those checks instead.  M ystery  D oes your gaming group love puzzles and extended  roleplaying sessions? Mystery is a classic story -  telling construct that shifts the focus of games from  fighting monsters to social interactions and deductive  reasoning. A great mystery will get your players just as  invested in solving it as their characters are!  W hy   u se   m ystery ?  Everyone loves a good mystery. It’s fun to solve a challeng -  ing puzzle, brainstorming how the pieces fit together and  seeing how assumptions and conclusions change when  new clues are revealed. Drama and suspense grow when  characters confront possible thieves, murderers, kidnap -  pers, or worse. There are unexpected twists, false accusa -  tions, and red herrings to complicate matters.  Mysteries can occur in any setting. While the specifics  may change, people—and crimes—stay largely the same.  Burglary, con games, kidnappings, and murder can hap -  pen anywhere, and the perpetrator can be anyone from a  malfunctioning AI or evil elf to a regular person.  A mystery can make a great change of pace for your  group. Mysteries can have a lot less violence, giving  your PCs a chance to recuperate after a combat-heavy  session. They also let your players engage in serious  roleplaying and exercise their characters’ social skills.  t hemes   in   m ystery  Mysteries are easily divided by the type of crime or  mysterious situation involved. Your PCs might pursue  kidnappers, a crafty cat burglar, or a terrifying mur -  derer. Each brings its own challenges. Kidnappers might  impose a time limit to find the victim. Exposing a cat  burglar might mean infiltrating high society to take They broke into the starship's bridge only to find  the captain and ambassador both dead.

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 247  down a socialite turned thief. A murderer might be pick -  ing off victims as fast as the characters talk to them.  Locations also contribute to the theme. Classic who -  dunit thrillers isolate a group of characters in a house,  train, or other location that prevents anyone from leaving.  This limits the pool of suspects, as well as increasing the  suspense (since everyone knows the perpetrator is pres -  ent). Murder mysteries can happen anywhere, but a mur -  der at a society function feels very different than a knifing  in a back alley. And kidnappings can involve moving the  victim to exotic new locales, forcing your PCs to follow.  r unnin G   m ystery   - t heme D   G   ames  First, decide how light or dark you want your mystery to  be. A lighthearted mystery may involve a crime against  property, not a murder or kidnapping. However, you  can make life-threatening mysteries more lighthearted  by not threatening the PCs or anyone they care about.  Conversely, a darker story targets your player’s charac -  ters and their friends, upping the tension and stakes.  Second, you need to invent the actual mystery. That  means you have to invent the crime, which you can do  by answering these questions.  •   Who carried out the crime?  •   Why did they do it?  •   How did they do it?  •   Where did they do it?  •   What did they do it with?  •   Who are the victims? Did the perpetrator know them?  •   Who are the witnesses, if any?  •   What will the perpetrator do to protect themself?  •   What were the flaws in the plan (if there was a  plan)? What went wrong during the crime?  The answers to these questions also help you build the  clues you will reveal to the PCs as they investigate. As  you answer each question, invent a related clue that the  PCs can discover. Keep a list so you can mark off clues as  your PCs discover them. Keep in mind that mysteries are  never straightforward affairs, which is what makes them  good puzzles. Each clue should lead to multiple conclu -  sions, so that your group needs to discover multiple clues  to figure out which conclusion they have in common.  You’ll also get help from the player theories about what  is going on. Pay attention, as they also let you know how  well you are conveying the information. If the PCs' theo -  ries are far afield from what actually happened, you may  need to clarify some clues or provide some new ones.  Your players can follow a red herring, but you don’t want  them to do so over multiple sessions!  p ulp  A re you looking to play some high-action tales, fantas -  tic weird stories, or gritty, hard-boiled crime adven -  tures? Pulp originally referred to inexpensive fiction mag -  azines printed on cheap, low-quality wood pulp paper in  the early to mid-1900s. These magazines were full of weird  stories and action-packed adventures—big on excitement  even if they were a bit short on character development.  Pulp covered a wide variety of genres characterized by an  adventuresome spirit and larger-than-life story elements,  and the genre ended up influencing comics, stories, and  movies right up to present day.  W hy   u se   p ulp ?  Pulp stories are exceptionally well-suited to the casual,  fantastic action and melodramatic plots that are com -  mon to many RPG genres and adventures. Obvi -  ously, this is in part because those same RPG settings  grew from those original or influential sources. Pulp  includes fantasy, horror, Westerns, true crime or hard-  boiled crime mysteries, science fiction, and romance.  The tropes of pulp-style adventures are very recogniz -  able. These include expeditions into dangerous wilder -  nesses, clashes between high-society and criminal ele -  ments, encounters with horrifying creatures, and battles  with evil villains whose motivations seem more about  acting the part than accomplishing a reasonable goal.  Your players may generate characters who embody  equally recognizable tropes. These might include a  retired military commander, a bold but arrogant wan -  nabe hero, a naïve individual on their first adventure, a  cynical expert marksman, and more. All of these make  pulp a very accessible tone that is easy to roleplay. Somehow, the professor managed to convince  the university to send a team out to the midst of  the Atlantic Ocean. Their old, rusty research ves -  sel attested to the school’s limited resources and  the skeptical opinions of his preposterous theory.  Everyone donned their clunky brass diving suit and  descended into the deep. To their surprise, a light  greeted them at the bottom. Many lights. A city.  Atlantis was real. What’s more, it was still alive. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 248  t hemes   in   p ulp  Adventuring for adventuring’s sake is a common pulp  theme. Your characters may play brave explorers enter -  ing a strange wilderness or dangerous location, maybe  to make some discovery, maybe to find lost treasures.  "Hard-boiled" crime dramas are classic pulp. This  tone is often combined with the mystery tone (see pages  246 ). However, your crime drama doesn’t have to be a  mystery. Perhaps your group knows who the perpetra -  tor is and needs to either find evidence to bring them to  justice or take them down "the hard way."  Westerns are another pulp classic that you can mod -  ernize for a present-day adventure or adapt to a space  opera setting. Westerns often focus on the hard life on  the edges of civilization, and surviving with only your -  self, your friends, and your trusty six-shooter to rely on.  Pulp can also focus on fighting strange and terrifying  supernatural creatures. Obviously, this makes sense for  pairing pulp and horror. However, a pulp/horror game  focuses less on the devastating psychological damage  these creatures cause and more on defeating such threats  with dynamite and a tommy gun.  r unnin G   p ulp   - t heme D   G   ames  Pulp-themed games are filled with adventure. You’ll  want the characters to take risky actions. To encour -  age that, make most of your encounters less dangerous  or easier for your group to overcome. This emphasizes  the larger-than-life action hero element of the charac -  ters, and lets you ramp up the danger during climactic  encounters to make them more suspenseful.  Use story tropes to your advantage. Play them up to  reinforce the theme in the players’ minds. Don’t be afraid  to use melodramatic or cliché elements. The zombies are  always slow, or the criminal mastermind always gives  away their plot. Clichés can be central to your story, but  even as lesser encounters they support the tone.  Pulp stories are often serialized. Stories are broken up  into sections with natural breaks in the action, and often  they end abruptly in a climactic moment. This latter  technique is called the cliffhanger. It introduces an ele -  ment of danger and mystery to the main character’s fate,  right at the end of the story or scene. It encourages the  audience to seek out the next segment of the story to find  out what happens next. Periodically use this technique  to further enhance the pulp feel of your adventures.  n e W   r ules   :   t he   c liffhan G er  The cliffhanger is a classic trope used to leave the end of  a story unresolved and the main characters in immedi -  ate danger. You may use this rule at the end of a game  session that is not the end of the adventure, or at a  major encounter important to the story. At the end of  the session or encounter, the PCs are left in immediate  peril. At the beginning of the next session (or encoun -  ter), place all Story Points in the player pool. The PCs  may use these points in one of the following ways:  •   As normal while trying to escape the situation.  •   By spending all of the points immediately to nar -  ratively describe escaping the situation. The players  should describe the desired actions of their characters  and reactions by the NPCs. You must approve of the  events and the outcome, altering only what is neces -  sary to preserve important story or plot elements.  •   By spending all of the points to immediately restore  one or more dead or incapacitated characters, indi -  cating a miraculous recovery or narrow escape.  These characters heal half of their wounds and all  of their strain. The PCs then play out the scene.  r o M an C e   and   d ra M a  S o, have you or your group had enough combat for a  while? Are you looking to work new elements into  your games? Do your player characters need more  story-based development or personal involvement in  other aspects of the game setting? Adventures featur -  ing drama, romance, or both may fit the bill.  While romance and drama don’t have to be featured  simultaneously, they naturally work together. Love  and romance are often very dramatic, after all. These  tones work well in games with more mature or seri -  ous themes, as well as in games that focus on character  development and social interactions. Commander Sinclair stormed into the ambassa -  dor's office, slamming the door behind him. "You  cold-hearted bastard!"  The ambassador sighed. "I...I had no choice, John.  When you told me you'd be rotated back to the  capital, I had to use your fleet's absence as leverage  in the negotiations. ...I never wanted to hurt you."  Sinclair leaned over the desk, teeth set and tears  welling in his eyes. "Too late for that, Vance. What  we had between us was...I thought it was special.  But now, I'll remember your betrayal forever." Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 249  W hy   u se   r omance   an D   D rama ?  Drama requires emotional involvement, conflict, threats,  and risks. It highlights interpersonal play between mem -  bers of the party and NPCs. Drama adds a more seri -  ous tone to a game, and even lighter moments affect the  tension between characters. If your group wants serious  stories, you should add in some drama.  Romance brings different roleplaying and charac -  ter development opportunities to the table. It could  be as simple as romantic involvement between PCs or  between a PC and an NPC. However, romantic rela -  tionships are no easier to create and maintain in your  game than they are in real life, which usually leads to  drama. Romance between characters doesn’t have to be  an adventure’s focus. It can work well as a subplot in a  larger story. If you’re looking to add a layer of character  development to an adventure, romance can work well.  t hemes   in   r omance   an D   D   rama  Drama tends to focus on realistic conflicts and situa -  tions, though these can be adapted to fantasy and other  fictional environments. The story should move the  PCs emotionally (and hopefully your players are a bit  moved, too). Subgenres can provide variations when  adapted to your setting:  •   Courtroom dramas and other investigative stories  build tension as your characters reveal evidence  and build to a moment of truth with the verdict.  •   Historical and alternate history stories can place  the players right in the heart of dramatic times.  Period pieces are similar, focusing the story on the  physical trappings and social rules of the time.  •   Melodramas are highly emotional tales that spe -  cifically exaggerate characters or storylines in ways  that trade realism for story impact. This can work  well in roleplaying games where there may be  much less time to develop characters and stories.  •   Tragedies are classic drama, highlighting character  flaws that ultimately destroy a character. If your  players don’t want to see their characters destroyed,  consider doing this with a prominent NPC instead.  Romance tends to apply to subplots in a larger  adventure (and most stories have some sort of roman -  tic subplot in them). Even when romance is the focus  of the story, there is almost always something else in  the narrative that generates a conflict that characters  need to overcome. This is often some dramatic element  (hence the pairing of these tones), but it can also be an  investigation, diplomatic mission, or even straight-up  fight. Therefore, a romance’s themes tend to be colored  by the conflicts it runs alongside.  r unnin G   r omance   -   an D   D   rama   - t heme D   G   ames  Resolving conflicts is the basis of drama. Conflict occurs  in many forms and at many levels of intensity, so not  every scene rates life-altering importance. You want the  scenes to build up tension and suspense, at least at an  incremental pace. Ideally, the characters learn new ele -  ments that help them resolve the conflict or find reasons  behind its existence or possible end. If one aspect of the  drama resolves itself, you want a new situation to emerge  as a result. It may not be immediately apparent, however,  and some conflicts should end completely to prevent the  players from feeling like their efforts are futile.  Romance can generate some of these conflicts. If you’re  working a new romantic plot into your game, you’ll need  to start with the initial attraction between the two charac -  ters. Whether or not the characters pursue the romance  is the first conflict. If they do, work some obstacles in,  such as disapproving family members, conflicting politi -  cal or religious viewpoints, or even another love interest!  After the characters overcome these obstacles (or don’t),  you can keep the romance plot going by introducing an  occasional conflict into the story. Perhaps a love interest  feels ignored by a PC who constantly leaves them to go  on adventures. Maybe the relationship ends up produc -  ing children. Or perhaps a villain kidnaps a love interest  to get at the PC.  n e W   r ules   :   m eta G ame   m aneuverin G  In games with lots of drama and romance, your players  are probably going to know more than their characters  about a situation. Why not take advantage of that?  If a player character believes a lie or takes harmful  actions directly due to the manipulations of others (in  other words, if the player knows the action is against  their PC’s best interests), you should remove one Story  Point from the GM pool and add it to the player pool.  r o M anti C   a wkwardness  Romantic actions and conversations can be dif -  ficult for you and your group to play out. As many  players are friends or relatives, romantic scenes  can lead to some potentially awkward conversa -  tions. Before starting an adventure or scene focus -  ing on romance, you should discuss with your  players how they would like to handle it. Some  may prefer to avoid any descriptive details and  use the mechanics of skill checks to figure out the  results. Others may enjoy a narrative approach.  Either method works if the players are having fun. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

W hy   u se   s uperheroes ?  Superheroes can be sources of great fun for players and  GMs alike. They can also fit into any setting. Modern  adventures with characters who live ordinary lives when  not adopting their alter egos are perhaps the most famil -  iar. PCs could also be interstellar heroes who police the  stars in space opera, steampunk characters in clanking  battlesuits fighting against laser-firing zeppelins, or even  weird war super-soldiers as powerful as battleships.  The superhero tone inherently brings a grand scale  of action as well. Characters capable of leaping over  tall buildings or lifting locomotives inherently require  suitable   challenges,   after   all.   Such   adventures   are  often filled with dramatic tension, where failure could  mean a villain conquering the world, meteors dev -  astating cities, or even the end of all reality. Even in  games in which highly skilled humans fight crime, the  risks should be high, ranging from gunfire injuries to  unmasking. From halting volcanoes to halting a mug -  ging, the action is always serious, even if the characters  might toss puns as fast as their fists.  t hemes   in   s uperhero   G   ames  Superhero games are a great way to explore many  themes, especially those about the nature of individual  effort, something important in most roleplaying games.  PCs here often have extra-normal powers that make  them stand out from the rest of humanity. Even when  in groups or acting behind masks, they can be icons to  show how everyone can individually make a difference.  Identification is another major theme given that many  superheroes hide their identity behind a mask or dis -  guise. They might do this to protect themself or loved  ones. Some superheroes might believe their costumed  persona is their true identity, through which they can act  without societal repercussions. Other characters might  not even bother with alter egos, whether due to a desire  for fame or simply because it is not how their world  works. Maintaining a secret identity is a lot of work, but  players could find this as rewarding as the actual hero -  ics—after all, there will likely be many eager to learn who  is hiding behind those masks.  Another important theme is how the players relate  to local laws and governments. Are they acting in  conjunction with standard law enforcement, perhaps  even officially supported? Do they act above the law,  or against it should they view it as counter to their own  code? Here they might fight against corrupt officials as  much as against street-level crime.  Given the powers these characters can possess, their  own morality might be all that keeps them in check.  Thus, conflicting moral codes can be even more pow -  erful. Some characters might refuse to kill or even use  guns, while others might have no problem with perma -  nent solutions to their problems. How the PCs resolve  situations where lethal force is a tempting solution can  make for excellent games.  Last are the themes of character motivation. Is it to  fight crime, gain vengeance, or punish the wicked? Or is  aiding the helpless and guarding humanity what makes  them don their mask? Others might do this just for the  excitement of it all or a feeling their gifts are wasted  unless they use them. Differing motivations in the group  means differences in how characters react to situations  and act to resolve them, and might even lead to hero vs.  hero battles—a common trope for this tone.  r unnin G   s uperhero   - t heme D   G   ames  World-building is perhaps the most important step  when using this tone. How did superpowers arise?  Have they always been around (perhaps even com -  monplace), or is this a new, possibly frightening, occur -  rence? It’s even possible the PCs are the only superhe -  roes in this world and share a common origin story.  This could tie into their operation as a superteam, per -  haps with their own joint headquarters. Even without They staggered out of the Panopticon’s secret exit  into the morning sun, weary but still joking about  the battle. It took all night, but the Death Hive was  finally contained and safely buried underground  in hyperstasis.   A request for the Star Patrol to  retrieve the alien gestalt, a review of the week’s  duty roster, and now they could get back to their  daily lives. That was, until Halcyon spotted Doctor  Zed’s venomship streaking toward the Moon. Tired  or not, this looked like a job for the Ultra Union. Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)

GENESYS  Part III: Game Master's Toolkit 251  powers, the characters might decide to join together to  more effectively achieve their common goals.  While most groups aren’t that concerned over their  characters’ clothing, here costumes are a vital element  in games. They might be designed to protect the wearer,  frighten criminals, stow weaponry (or even be weapons  themselves in the case of battlesuits), or loudly identify  the superhero’s costumed identity to everyone nearby.  Most also act to hide real identities, perhaps their most  important function. Make sure all the players firmly  establish their costumes (assuming they chose to use  them) as part of character creation. Changes to their cos -  tumes should be major events, perhaps reflecting a new  heroic name or operating style.  Even the language of this tone should be a factor in  games. How would fellow superheroes address each other,  or the public? Would they use real names when in cos -  tume, assuming they even know that information? And  when they are out of costume, do they talk and act differ -  ently to maintain their alter egos? Some might even work  to develop their real identity into a radically different per -  sona, to aid in maintaining their life out of costume.  Given the nature of this tone, most players will want to  start their characters with existing powers. They should  work with you, the GM, to identify such abilities. This  should be tied to the power level the group has decided is  appropriate for the campaign. It could be that no one has  actual superpowers—that though they wear costumes  and fight crime, they are all just very skilled humans.  Alternatively, characters could have godlike strength,  sound-barrier-cracking speed, flight, and other classic  abilities from comic books. Our super-characteristics  rule represents this to some extent, and you can also use  the magic rules and rules for constructing new talents to  invent new superhuman abilities.  n e W   r ules   :   n o   m ere   m ortal  Superhero-themed games assume that the PCs are  stronger, faster, and better than average people right  from character creation. To represent this, during  character creation, increase each PC’s starting XP by 50  (this can be spent on characteristics) and allow them to  increase skills to rank 3.  In addition, since superheroes traditionally fight  with their fists, you should allow PCs and supervillains  to deal base damage equal to twice their Brawn when  making unarmed attacks.  n o   m ere   m ortal   :   p uny   m inions  If you want your PCs to feel a cut above regular mor -  tals, you can take the No Mere Mortal rule one step  further. When a minion or minion group attacks a PC  or supervillain, their attack can inflict a maximum of 1  wound or strain after damage reduction.  n e W   r ules   :   s uper   - c haracteristics  Super-characteristics represent your characters having  attributes that are more than human. Even superheroes  who are nominally "normal" people tend to display supe -  rior Cunning, Intellect, or other characteristics in a super -  hero-themed game, so this applies to any superhero.  During character creation, your players should select  two of their character’s six characteristics. These are their  character’s   super-characteristics —super strength, super  speed or agility, or super intelligence, for example. You  should also do this whenever you create a nemesis NPC  that you intend to be a supervillain.  When a character makes a check based on one of their  super-characteristics, if the check generates a   󲊵 , immedi -  ately roll an additional   󲊻   into the pool. If that   󲊻   gener -  ates another   󲊵 , then roll an additional   󲊻   into the pool  again. The player still gets to resolve all of the   󲊵   as usual.  This can lead to some impressive results with lots of   󲊵 ,  which you should interpret as appropriately "super." Brawl  checks punch opponents into the stratosphere, Coordina -  tion checks catch civilians falling hundreds of feet, and  Perception checks hear what’s going on miles away.  y ou ’ re   o nly   as   g ood   as   y our   v illain  The one thing that really makes a superhero  adventure work is the archnemesis. No matter the  type of campaign, your PCs need to face powerful  challenges, and the best have a face behind them.  Developing villains to battle your group should  be an important part of running a superhero-  themed game, and grand fun for you, too.  First off, try to match villains to your players. A  scientific genius or magic-using villain would be  a good match for groups strong on raw powers,  for example. A powerful corporate conspiracy  could bedevil those keen on urban patrols or  crimebusting. A good villain is the antitheses to  the heroes, after all!  Like all antagonists, supervillains should also  evolve and grow just like the players. No great vil -  lain stays down for long, regardless of the appar -  ently permanent nature of their demise. They  should always be ready to show up again, sporting  a new bionic arm, costume, superpower, and of  course, a renewed desire for vengeance! Knut Sveidqvist (Order #41004747)
