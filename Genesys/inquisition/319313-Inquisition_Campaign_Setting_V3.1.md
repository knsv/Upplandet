Inquisition Introduction  4  Introduction  What is Inquisition?  T his book is a game supplement for the Genesys Role  Playing Game by Fantasy Flight Games. Within  these pages you will find material to play a unique gritty  low-fantasy setting with a pinch of horror.  Inspiration  Inquisition   setting is inspired by real Earth’s medieval  age; mostly from its political structure with lords and  vassals. Coming out of many years of   Dungeons and  Dragons   and   Pathfinder , I wanted to reduce the fantasy  level and go back to something closer to Middle Ages.  The idea of the   Inquisition   came to me while play -  ing the   Graveyard Keeper   video game, in which some  inquisition takes place in the background. It seemed  interesting to me though that witches would actually  be real and not just an excuse for the Church to burn  down people.  With witches in the setting, I thought it would be  interesting to have dark fantasy elements, horrors that  the characters could face, but without turning them  into heroes slaying hordes of demons, undead and  other aberrations. The creatures in this setting would  always be difficult to beat, and potentially leaving last -  ing traumas to the characters. The inspirations behind  the creatures you will see in this book are coming from  various movies, random Pinterest pictures, Grimm fai -  rytales and the   Darkest Dungeon   videogame.  Required Material  To make use of this document, you need the   Genesys  Core Rulebook   as it contains the rules to play the game,  as well as material that are referenced inside this cam -  paign setting book, such as talents.  Sharing its medieval base theme with   Realms of Ter -  rinoth   setting, a lot of material, including gear, talents,  craftsmanship rules, are borrowed from it. While you  can still play a campaign with only   Inquisition   docu -  ment and the   Genesys Core Rulebook , you will get the  best out of the setting if you also own   Realms of Ter -  rinoth   source book.  Theme  Inquisition   is a medieval setting featuring both hor -  ror and fantasy elements. Depending on the campaign  type, both the elements may vary greatly in incidence.  Tones  Various types of adventures can be made within this  vast setting. The ongoing inquisition against the witch -  es brings its lot of mystery and intrigue. Venturing into  the old empire ruins could bring pulp and horror while  the feudal system of the world adds both intrigue and  drama to the table. Whatever the tone you are after, you  are likely going to be able to play it within   Inquisition .  Fear Rules  Inquisition   makes use of the optional fear rules on page  143 of the   Genesys Core Rulebook , including the Sanity  rules.  The dark creatures that the characters will face dur -  ing their adventure will challenge their own beliefs of  what should be possible or not. Each time the super -  natural is present, fear checks should be there as well.

Inquisition Chapter 1: Overview  6  Chapter 1: Overview  The World of Inquisition  B eyond the scope of the common eye lurk dark  creatures, witches and evil magic. While for the  common folk these are merely legends and myths, the  Church is actually concerned about these and is trying  to fight the evil nature of the world by maintaining an  inquisition. Inquisitors, templars and monster hunters  roam the lands, seeking and killing witches and other  supernatural atrocities.  Above the common folk, nobles fight each other for  more land, titles and resources.  While population has spread all around Eguras, vast  lands are still uncharted, either on the continent or  beyond. It is a perfect opportunity for adventurers to  prove themselves by exploring the ruins of the crum -  bled witch empire, fighting off dark creatures, claiming  new lands and making a name for themselves.  Despite its history filled with magic, the world of   In -  quisition   is fairly low on fantasy. There are no wizards  nor mages, no classical fantasy species such as elves,  dwarves and orcs and no magical objects and weapons  being traded around the world. Instead of heroes bat -  tling dragons and slaying ancient evils, characters are  more likely to investigate peasant communities for the  occult, maneuver through political webs of decadent  nobles and make harsh choices based on even harsher  circumstances.  Life on Sondara  Inquisition   takes place on the world of Sondara, where  civilization is currently in its own medieval age not en -  tirely unlike Europe’s 11th century.  Once the empire fell, people scattered all across the  continent. Powerful leaders rose from the ashes of the  empire, and became rulers of their own petty fiefs. In  time, those leaders became kings, their fiefs kingdoms.  It’s been 649 years since the fall of the empire, and  much of the writings of that age have been burned or  lost. The people have forgotten what truly hides in the  dark and for most, such creatures are tall tales. After  years without signs of anything supernatural, witches  and dark creatures have been sighted. These incidents  are isolated for now, but the Church cannot stand aside.  Fearing a resurgence of dark powers, the Church has  launched an unprecedented inquisition. Priests in all  communities are now on the lookout for any signs of  witchcraft. Mixing zeal with fear, they are quick to ac -  cuse and condemn those they think are witches, even  though they might lack proof. Over the years, the in -  quisition has led to a growing fear and suspicion among  the people, a world where nobody is truly safe and even  trusted friends could harbor evil in their hearts.  The Creation  The Church of the Creator’s foundation dates back to  the fall of the Midnight Empire. Its teachings have since  reached everywhere but the most reclusive bastions of  humanity.  As per its teachings, what came before Sondara was  a complete and infinite void from which a single entity  came into existence. That entity had its own goals and  designs and created the universe, along with Sondara.  The entity, which would be known simply as the   Cre -  ator, bestowed life upon the world. But somehow, its  attempts at intelligent life forms became twisted.  In order to create a better form of life, capable of co -  operating, developing a culture, demonstrating love  and compassion, the Creator had to reject a part of it -  self that was darker. By doing so, it created unique en -  tity composed mostly of everything that made it previ -  ously imperfect;   Lilithia.  Then, the Creator created humanity. Humans started  to evolve by themselves, ignorant of their creator’s exis -  tence, as it stood silently watching.  Lilithia, being a chaotic yet ambitious being, tried to  play with the world herself, but her powers were not  strong enough to actually alter the planet. Slipping

Inquisition Chapter 1: Overview   7  past the Creator’s vigilance and using her still-growing  powers, Lilithia managed to enter the mortal realm as  a newborn child.  The Rise of the Mother Witch  Even though she was not nearly as powerful as the Cre -  ator, she was still superior to all mankind. Her powers  manifested as what is now known as witchcraft, and  Lilithia was the very first of her kind; the mother of  witches. Blessed with immortality, she bred multiple  children; exclusively daughters, each of whom with the  potential for witchcraft. While they were not immortal  themselves, their sorcerous powers blessed them with a  lifespan longer than that of any normal human being.  Much like the Creator, Lilithia had a plan from the  start: seizing control of humanity through her and her  daughters’ magic. At some point during history, they  manipulated their way up the social ranks, using magic  to fend off opposition. Every king was quickly swapped  with a witch, mind controlled, or simply charmed to  act accordingly to their plans. Lilithia crowned herself  empress of all humanity. That united civilization be -  came known as the Midnight Empire.  For an indefinite period of time, Lilithia kept the  humans under her yoke, forcing them into slavery and  worship. Even today, it is not clear exactly what Lilithia  wanted to achieve with this. Was it only to satisfy her  desire for power? Or was it an attempt to destroy the  Creator’s work as a way to avenge his denial of the pow -  er of creation to her? The answer remains a mystery.  Prophet  The Creator could not bear to stand aside for eternity.  One day, a young slave who was working in the mines  received a vision from the Creator. It was one of hope,  a dream of freedom and the fall of the empress. That  nameless man was blessed with a powerful gift: immu -  nity to witchcraft, Lilithia’s main weapon against hu -  manity. Guided by his visions, he freed himself from  the mines along with others. He slowly recruited people  to his cause and spread his knowledge of the Creator.  His actions and words earned him the name Prophet.  Within few years, whispers grew among the slaves  that Prophet would defeat the empress and word got  to Lilithia. She would not believe such nonsense and  never really felt worried. That is, until some of her  daughters were mysteriously slaughtered. Prophet ig -  nited the spirits of the slaves, and they rebelled against  their witch mistresses.  The Fall of the Midnight Empire  During that war, thousands humans died as the witches  were only slowly defeated. Still, Prophet was still stand -  ing and his close companions, who are now known as  the apostles of the Creator, were keeping morale up.  Eventually, Prophet brought the fight up to the Mid -  night Tower, Lilithia’s center of power, and defeated her.  As her blood spilled on the floor, her control over the  minds of many nobles ceased and the war swiftly came  to a halt. The remaining witches fled into the wilder -  ness to avoid the same fate as their mother. The freed  people were more concerned about rebuilding a home  for themselves than pursuing Lilithia’s daughters into  the wild. Most left their existing settlements as they  feared that the magic lingering there would corrupt  their children, crops and souls. And thus, even today,  the ruins of the empire lay uncharted. Even though  expeditions took place to uncover its secrets, most of  them did not return and those who did left their par -  ticipants psychologically scarred by the horrific events  they witnessed back there.  A new Era  After the war, some people were still blessed with  enough valuables and resources to bring people togeth -  er; building new settlements and laying the founda -  tions for a new civilization. The population expanded,  new villages sprouting up as people spread. Kingdoms  formed and humans waged multiples wars for various  reasons.  The Church of the Creator became a renowned in -  stitution, its seat standing in the city-state Prophet’s  Landing; the settlement Prophet founded after the war.  There stands a gigantic cathedral towering over nearby  buildings. Its religious leader, the Pope, holds a massive  influence on world’s politics. The Church has a delegate  in every major settlement in every kingdom. Even the  frontier villages are likely to have a church or shrine of  sort, maintained by a priest. Worship of the Creator is  present everywhere, and the priests always have a word  in what is happening in a given community. They hold  sermons, can summon templars and condemn people  for witchcraft.  Contrary to real-life Middle Ages, women and men  hold equal social rank. While some kingdoms have  their own unique inheritance rules, the majority follow  the law of primogeniture, whereupon the ruler’s death,  the power goes to their first child, or the spouse should  the child not be old enough to rule yet.

Inquisition Chapter 2: Politics  8  Chapter 2: Politics  T he humans of Eguras built their civilization soon af -  ter the fall of the Midnight Empire. People have fled  the area as they feared that the lingering magic would  cause them harm. Most people fled toward the west  as the path was more easily navigable. To the east, the  mountain range still drew some people in but even to -  day, people from Eguras do not know what stands on the  other side of the Midnight Mountains.  It did not took long for the refugees to gather into  small groups and form tribes. Some of them found a  land to settle down and started building up communi -  ties, while others pursued nomadic lifestyle. The settle -  ments developed their own political systems, diplomat -  ic relations and economy. As the years passed, some of  them formed alliances and the most influential families  raised in power and with time, kingdoms were founded  across the continent of Eguras.  Inner Politics  Feudalism  The people of Eguras live by the principles of a caste  system and feudalism. There are currently nine king -  doms across the Eguras continent, which for most  people represent the known world, and they all follow  a similar system.  Nobility  Above all is the ruler of the kingdom. Their word is law  and they can do pretty much whatever they want inside  their own kingdom. The only people that they try not  to displease are their immediate vassals as well as the  Pope. While not as powerful, a ruler’s vassals, when al -  lied together can overthrow a monarch. The Pope on  the other side has a strong influence in world politics  and can launch a crusade against a specific kingdom  and excommunicate individuals. Beside the pope and  his archbishops, the monarch owns everything and ev -  eryone inside their kingdom.  Inheritance  Inheritance laws may differ depending on specific  kingdom and reigns. Within the same kingdom, the  different duchies, counties or baronies may use dif -  ferent laws. Many use the primogeniture, in which the  eldest legitimate child inherit all the titles from the de -  ceased ruler. Should the ruler have no child but have  grand-children, the titles go to the eldest child of his  eldest deceased child.  Should the titles be passed to a child who is young -  er than 15 years old; a steward is nominated until the  new ruler comes of age. Depending of the kingdom,  the steward is generally nominated by the spouse, the  nobles or the bishop.  Marriage  Marriage is a means of establishing alliances and ulti -  mately, an opportunity of having heirs. Love is gener -  ally put second rank in terms of priorities. This fact is  even more common among the nobility as alliances are  precious and can seal the fate of a lineage or kingdom.  Marriage is organized by the subject’s lord for the no -  bles, while for the peasants and craftsmen, the parents  are generally the ones pulling the strings. Occasionally,  mostly among those who do not own titles or lands,  partners can decide to marry each other. The latter  tends to produce happier couples as their foundation is  based on love rather than political interests.  When a marriage is organized, negotiations take  place to determine if it is going to be either a patrilineal  or matrilineal wedding. This is of crucial importance  for determining rules of inheritance, as the marriage’s  structure will affect who is going to gain the titles once  the ruler dies. Rare exceptions aside, the wealthiest  partner get the better of these negotiations.

Inquisition Chapter 2: Politics   9  Vassals  While the rulers hold the most power in Eguras, they  cannot manage the population by themselves. There -  fore, a kingdom is split into duchies, which are ruled by  a duke or duchess. A duchy is still a pretty large piece  of land so a duke will split his lands into separate coun -  ties, each ruled by a count or countess. And finally, the  count splits his territory into small pieces of land called  baronies, which are ruled by a baron or baroness. A  barony consists of a single settlement, with a few acres  of land.  Each of these vassal titles are granted by the noble  just above them in the hierarchy. Once such title has  been granted, that title passes down to the noble’s chil -  dren as per the inheritance rules. It is possible, though,  for a noble to dismiss one of his vassals but this act  should be motivated by a rightful cause, such as heresy.  Dismissal of a noble without the support of the Church  or the noble above may draw the ire of the other nobles  of the same rank and even above.  Internal   Warfare  Internal war occurs when two vassals declare war on  each other. In a time where land grants are not that pre -  cise, overlap can occur and barons, counts and dukes  have to make a display of power to take what they claim  is rightfully theirs. Sometimes, the inheritance can be  a bit blurry and some titles are claimed by some other  noble. In this case, war generally settles the argument.  When going into war, a ruler can call to arms all their  vassals to support the war effort. Failing to answer the  call to arms normally resolves in dismissal. Depending  on the rules in place, going to war against a vassal of  the same lord might require the lord’s permission. For  example, a count might have to grant permission for  two of his barons to fight each other.  Caste System  The people of Eguras are separated by categories that  dictate their role and rights in society.  Above all is the   ruler , may it be a king or a queen,  which rules the kingdom. They have a right on the life  on every one of their subjects.  After the ruler comes the   high nobility . This encom -  passes the ruler’s spouse, children, siblings which are  all considered nobility.  Then comes the   lesser nobility , which are vassals:  dukes, counts and barons, and their respective families.  Under the vassals are the   knights . These noble war -  riors were granted a honorific title and private land  within the fiefdom. Knights are good candidates for the  title of baron should the count dismiss the current one  or should a land be conquered. Warriors are knighted  by their lord for heroic deeds.  Then come the   merchants . They trade goods be -  tween settlements, buying merchandise and carrying it  around to sell at a higher price. Rich merchants some -  times own mansions, with their own set of mercenary  guards and servants.  Coming close behind are the   craftsmen ; blacksmiths,  coopers, jewelers, shipwrights and other artisans. From  their craft, they can make some money, and sometimes  even buy a parcel of land for themselves.  After come the   peasants . Peasants work the land by  farming, woodcutting, mining and other tasks their  lord requires of them. Peasants do not own any land.  Their homes are rented by the lord. Basically, peasants  have to pay to live on the land they work for, while do -  ing the work for their lord. For this reason, peasants are  mostly poor and cannot afford many personal belong -  ings.  Finally, there are the   serfs . Serfs are mostly peasants  but their living existence is tied to the land on which  they live. Their life is owned by the landlord and they  cannot leave it. Everything they have also belongs to  the lord, up to their clothes. Should a serf want to leave  the land, they have to pay the lord in order to have him  permit this freedom. Since serfs are the poorest of the  people, they generally cannot afford that cost. Being a  serf is not that far from being a simple slave.  It is unlikely, but not impossible, to raise one’s own  position within the caste system. A very lucky peas -  ant could be knighted after performing heroic deeds  on during an ongoing war, and then again be granted  a barony. Unfortunately for them, these cases are ex -  tremely rare. Most people live and die as part of the  same caste they were born into.  The   Court  The court is an extended royal household, which hous -  es those who regularly attend to the lord of the place,  which includes courtiers, entertainers, ambassadors,  bodyguards and even concubines.  Every lord holds a court. While a baron might hold  a few individuals lodged in humble accommodations,  a monarch’s court can hold up to a few hundreds souls  lodging in a dedicated wing of the castle, with servants  and classy accommodations.

Inquisition Chapter 2: Politics  10  Normally, every noble has an envoy assigned to the  court of their lord and one to each of their vassal. For  example, a duke would have an envoy at their queen’s  court, and one at each of his vassals’ court, which are  counts and countesses.  The envoys have the responsibility of representing  their lord and carry messages for them. Needless to say,  they usually play a big part in the intrigue of nobles’  house.  World Politics  Warfare  Relations between kingdoms are sometimes tense as  they share borders. Coveted resources, blurry succes -  sion lines, alliance to an enemy are a few reasons king -  doms go to war.  These wars are the most bloody as the rulers will call  to arms their vassals, which in turn will call theirs and  so on until it reaches the barons, thus mobilizing every  able man and woman of the kingdom.  Launching an attack on another kingdom prior to  making a war declaration is something considered un -  lawful, something that draws the attention of other rul -  ers and even the pope.  To declare a war, one ruler must have a casus belli,  which is an act or event that provokes or is used to jus -  tify war. The most common are a land, title claim or  having an ally being attacked.  A declaration of war takes the form of a herald of  arms delivering a “letter of battle” to the opposing par -  ty. These letters include the requests and claims from  the issuing ruler. These could be as simple as “release  the captive princess of Greenshire or our army will  march against you.”  The war should end once both parties sign a treaty,  with the defending nation having conceded or not to  the demands of the attacking kingdom.  Religion  The Church of the Creator is influential within all the  kingdoms of Eguras. The seat of the religion is centered  at the Cathedral of the Holy Flame, in Prophet’s Land -  ing. From there, Pope Abraham VIII keeps an eye on  world politics. His words are law for everything touch -  ing religion, morality, and he can excommunicate peo -  ple or launch crusades and inquisitions.  Every lord of the kingdoms wants to please the pope  as the Church has the most power around, being able to  muster forces all around Eguras. Since the Church does  not have an extensive standing army, its power comes  not only from the money each lord pays to get the  pope’s support, but primarily out of fear of what will  happen of them after death. People hope that if they  live a good life, their soul will travel to the heavens and  will live an utopian afterlife at the Creator’s side. On the  other hand, failing to live by the Church’s values will  have your soul travel to Lilithia’s domain, where it is  tortured for eternity.  Therefore, people go each Sunday to their local  church to listen the priest’s sermon, and confess their  sins, hoping for guidance and repentance.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion   11  Chapter 3: Religion  Origin  T he Church of the Creator traces its origin back to  the   Midnight Empire and more importantly, its fall.  The first mention of the Creator was just about two year  before the empress was defeated.  Back then, civilization was under the reign of Lili -  thia and her witch daughters. Every position of power  in society was held by a witch. Since they were not  numerous enough, they had to put non witches into  positions of lesser importance, such as slave masters,  administrators and such. These men and women were  sometimes truly loyal to the witches, sometimes magi -  cally charmed and forced into service. For the rest of  the population, they were slaves, working the land day  and night and pushed beyond their limits.  The seat of Lilithia’s domain was perched atop a  mountain, in a massive structure called the   Midnight  Tower, from where she pursued her dark schemes.  Prophet  Born as a slave and confined in a quarry, the nameless  man was indistinguishable from any other slave. One  night, when he was twenty years old, the man had a  dream. The following morning, he told a story of hope  and freedom. He claimed that he saw the creator of the  world, and it explained to him the origin of Lilithia but  also her weakness; silver. Then, it incited him to escape  and ignite rebellion.  While uprisings were attempted in the past, they al -  ways ended in violent bloodshed and not a single one  was successful. But this time, the man was filled with  confidence and zealous conviction. His stories of the  dream encounter with the Creator earned him the  name of Prophet.  Turning mining picks against their masters, the  slaves successfully managed to reclaim their freedom.  While other slaves would have normally fled far away  and rebuilt their life, Prophet was driven by his vision  and would not stop rebelling before he would have  freed all the slaves and killed Lilithia.  The Defeat of the Mother Witch  It took about a year for Prophet to actually attempt to  defeat Lilithia, the Mother Witch. Armed with silver-  tipped spears, Prophet and his army of freed slaves as -  saulted the Midnight tower, fighting through witches  and bewitched guards.  Prophet, along with ten of his most trusted men,  reached the top floor of the tower, where the throne  Lilithia as a Divine Being  Despite the image of Lilithia that the Church spreads, Lilithia is not a woman but a genderless divine be -  ing. Its magical powers let it assume the form it favored at any given time and no one could tell what its  true appearance might have been, if it even has one.  What is true though is that most of the time, it was assuming a feminine form. From this fact, as well as its  name sounding closer to a woman’s than a man’s, the Church considers and depicts this entiy as a woman.  This assumption led them to enforce that witchcrafting, as well as the primal evil, is coming from women,  while no verifiable facts support their opinion.  For the sake of this document and ease of reading, Lilithia uses the feminine pronouns even though she is  not technically a woman.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion  12  room stood. He challenged Lilithia and killed her by  piercing her heart with his spear. While the fact of a  simple man defeating Lilithia is improbable at best,  Prophet’s immunity to witchcraft would have been the  key to his victory.  The Foundation of the   Church  As Lilithia’s blood dripped on the floor, it seems that  every witch in the world became aware of their moth -  er’s death. Each of them fled the empire in favor of the  wilds, vanishing into the dark corners of the world.  After his victory, Prophet addressed his fellow war -  riors who have witnessed the event, naming them  apostles and asked them to have all the slaves flee their  lands. The Creator told him in a dream that staying  close to the Midnight Empire would corrupt their soul,  would turn them into hideous creatures and prevent  their soul from reaching heavens upon their death.  People fled to the west as it was more easily navigable  while the east was filled with treacherous mountains.  Still, a handful of people tried their luck but it is not  known what happened to them after that.  Prophet, his apostles and many followers traveled to -  gether in hope of finding a hospitable land. Each day,  dozens of people left the group to settle where they  stood, exhausted from marching all day. But Prophet,  along others, kept going until they reached a land that  seemed right for a new settlement. Here, they founded  a hamlet named Prophet’s Landing. Years later, this set -  tlement would hold the Cathedral of the Holy Flame,  the seat of the Church of the Creator.  Only two years after the founding of Prophet’s Land -  ing, Prophet died. Some say he died to the hands of dis -  ease but apostles claimed that his soul merely returned  to the heavens to rejoin the Creator, leaving his un -  needed body behind. Some even believe that Prophet  was indeed the Creator, taking up mortal form to free  the humans from Lilithia.  Today, the Church claims that Prophet’s tomb lies in  the Sanctified Catacombs below the cathedral, along  with the first apostles, the popes and archbishops that  came after.  The Church’s Hierarchy  After Prophet’s death, the apostles established a struc -  ture to manage the Church. They elected one of their  own to become the Pope. Each of the nine other apos -  tles became archbishops. As the Church grew over the  years and religious practices spread, people showed  interest in joining the Church. The archbishops took  some of them and taught them to become bishops.  Once ready, the bishops joined the other settlements  and established smaller churches here and there. The  faith people had in the Church aided it to grow even  more influential, taking a stand in some political deci -  sions and even managing to instill a mandatory tax for  every individual to pay to the Church. Finally, as the  Church grew, the structure got more organized with  different ranks and methods of climbing the religious  ladder.  Pope  The current pope is   Abraham VIII. The pope is the  leader of the Church and lives in the Cathedral of the  Holy Flame. He is the most influential man in the world  and also the richest. Receiving taxes from every settle -  ment of Eguras, he can muster large number of soldiers  to support his agendas.  When the pope dies, a new one has to be elected. The  archbishops gather and nominate a new pope amongst  themselves. This process can take up a few days, while  they all stand isolated inside the Cathedral of the Holy  Flame. An archbishop is elected in unanimity. Then,  the new pope chooses his new name, which consist of  the name of one of the ten   apostles, followed by a num -  ber representing the amount of previous popes that  shared   the same name, plus one. The ten names are  Abraham, Archer, Christobald, Jacob, Jeffrey, Joshua,  Lewis, Nicholas, Raymond, and Victor.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion   13  When a pope dies, his corpse is buried inside the  Sanctified Catacombs, underneath the cathedral. Since  popes are elected upon the death of their predecessor,  most popes that are elected are mostly of venerable age.  Therefore, most of them only occupy this position for a  few years before passing on.  Pope’s Powers  The pope has three distinct powers that have a world-  scale impact:  First of these powers is   Excommunication . When  excommunicated, a person is excluded from the reli -  gious community. In the eyes of the Church, that mem -  ber is a heretic. This opens them to hostilities as heresy  is a motive sufficient enough to wage war. Should a  ruler get excommunicated, their vassals generally turn  against them and are not judged for doing so. Other  kingdoms are also likely to engage hostilities. While  excommunication is generally definitive, someone may  be able to gain the pope’s favor back and reintegrate the  religious community. When a ruler is excommunicat -  ed, it is wise for their court to remove them from his  ruling position, showing their cooperation to the pope  and therefore, avoiding likely conflicts. The pope must  be careful to not overuse this power as, contrary to  kingdom rulers, his position is elected and not granted  by birth and he can be demoted if all the archbishops  wish so.  Then comes   Crusade . A crusade is a general call to  arms to every kingdom. The pope declares a faction,  whether it is a kingdom or a group of individuals and  every kingdom is called to participate in the war. While  kingdom rulers are not required to participate, doing  so helps to gain the favor of the pope and he can even  grant conquered lands to those who supported the war  effort. A single crusade has taken place in the history of  Eguras, back in 373 when the pope opposed Vanasha, a  witch that ruled a kingdom in the southwestern region  of the continent. That crusade lasted sixteen years.  Finally is the   Inquisition . When the Church suspects  the presence of witches, the pope can launch an inqui -  sition. The Church keeps at its disposal a special force  of templars; holy warriors wielding silver weapons. In  time of inquisition, these warriors wander the lands  in search of witches. Templars have an authority that  is on par with rulers concerning witches and heretics.  Should a templar condemn a person to death due to  witchcraft, rulers are advised to go with it as opposing  a templar raises the risk of excommunication from the  pope.  Archbishop  Archbishops are the pope’s closest advisors. Living in -  side the Cathedral, they help the pope with managing  the whole religious structure, coordinating templars,  reading reports and maintaining the Church’s books.  Archbishops who pass away are also buried inside  the Sanctified Catacombs, in a separate section.  When an archbishop is elected pope, passes away  or somehow leaves their position in the hierarchy, a  new archbishop is elected. Every bishop can compete  for the position, making a pilgrimage to the cathedral  and presenting themselves before the archbishops. The  archbishops vote together, basing their choice on influ -  ence, deeds and income, among other factors. The new  archbishop is elected by majority.  Bishop  Bishops are the highest religious authority outside of  the Cathedral of the Holy Flame. They maintain ca -  thedrals and large churches among the kingdoms. The  rank of bishop is granted once a priest has served long  enough and has a set income and parishioners. While  they fill mostly the same role as the priests, the bishop  rank is required to apply for the position of archbishop.  For these reasons, bishops mostly maintain cathe -  drals in large cities and capitals. They tend to show up  often at a ruler’s court and some dukes and duchesses  even have the pleasure of having an bishop living in  their town.  Priest  Priests maintain parishes all around the kingdoms.  Even the smallest settlement will have a chapel or at  least a shrine where people gather on Sundays to hear  the priest’s sermon. It is the lowest rank in the religious  hierarchy allowed to speak the sermons and make use  of the confessionals.  To become a priest, a man must have served as a  Brother for at least five years and the priest of his  church must forward his application to a bishop. If the  bishop supports the promotion, the Brother becomes a  priest and can hold sermons.  It is not unlikely for a church to have two priests si -  multaneously. But most of the time, newly promoted  priests are assigned a church in a new community or  replace a priest that passed or left their position some -  how.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion  14  Until three years ago, when Queen Meriel of Trimira  forced the pope’s hand, priesthood was a male exclusive  position. Now, women can be promoted to the role of  priestess.  Inquisitors  Since the start of the   Inquisition, some priests were  reassigned to investigation duties. Rather than speak -  ing sermons, these inquisitors focus their attention on  seeking out witches. Once they find their mark, they  decide whether to muster local forces or call in the  templars should the threat requires the Church’s direct  intervention.  Brother  Brother is the lowest rank a man can occupy within the  religious hierarchy. Every man wanting to join the orga -  nization starts at this rank. Brothers maintain church -  es, mostly by cleaning them and their ornaments and  help the priests with their sermons. Brothers double as  scribes and are taught to read and write should they not  know already, which is the case for most candidates.  Becoming a brother is a double edged sword. It helps  to raise the prestige of a family and earns the favor of  the Church. Also, the brothers are housed and fed dur -  ing their service.  The drawbacks are that brothers are not able to help  their family with land and labour, which can be a big  deal for farmers and even craftsmen. Also, brothers  must take a vow of chastity, which prevents the contin -  uation of the lineage. Brothers also cannot hold noble  titles. For this reason, few nobles actually volunteer to  serve as brothers as it invalidates their claim to the title.  Still, some may be so far down the lineage that they  could barely hope to hold a title at any point in their  life and thus volunteer to join. Sometimes, it is because  they have brought dishonor to their family and joining  the brothers is somehow a way to redeem themselves.  Finally, nobles can entrust their children to the Church.  This is done mostly to get rid of troublesome offspring.  Note that brothers are not always assigned to the  church in their hometown. In fact, most are assigned  elsewhere, so family would not interference with the  brother’s duties.  Sister  The Church has a history of distrust against women.  After all, the Church’s historical antithesis is pictured as  a woman and the religion’s patron, while actually gen -  derless, is mostly spoken of as being male.  Up until three years ago, sister was the highest rank  a woman could hope to reach in the organization.  Thanks to Queen Meriel of Trimira, sisters can now  reach priesthood and even become bishops.  Templars  Templars do not really fit into the rest of the hierarchy  as they fill a completely different role. Templars are the  holy warriors of the church. That sub-organization is  called the   Inquisitorium.  Petitioners must undergo a series of tests, both of  physical prowess and religious knowledge. For this rea -  son, many petitioners have either spent a lot of time at  the church or are brothers or priests.  The petitioners are tested directly at the Cathedral  of the Holy Flame, under the supervision of the High  Templar. Those selected will undergo intense training  until they are granted the title Templar.  The Templars stay mostly at the Cathedral unless  there is an ongoing crusade or inquisition. During cru -  sade, templars serve as a separate armed force under  the direct orders of the Church. During an inquisition,  they roam the lands in search of signs of witchcraft.  In addition to their standard weapons, each templar  wields an alchemical silver weapon, mostly a sword or  a spear. These weapons are of deadly efficiency against  the witches they hunt.  High Templar  All these men are led by the High Templar, a veteran  from within the ranks, promoted directly by the pope.  The current High Templar is Simon Velton and he has  occupied this position for the last eight years. There are  about one thousand templars within the ranks.  Like priesthood, the templars have opened their  ranks to women three years ago and some of them have  already been promoted and wander the lands rooting  out witches.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion   15  Prophet’s Landing  When Prophet and his apostles settled down with other  slaves, they founded a little settlement that would later  become the seat of the religion.  Years later, the little hamlet has become a prosperous  city, if not the largest in Eguras. Its fourteen thousands  people are talented craftsmen, merchants and members  of the religious order. Farmlands are found around the  city and many produce grapes for the wineries.  The   Cathedral of the Holy Flame  The Cathedral of the Holy Flame is the seat of the  Church’s power. The imposing structure towers over all  buildings men ever built. Its stone walls are decorated  with statues of priests, templars and colorful stained  glass windows. The walls inside are filled with paintings  depicting the stories the fall of the Midnight Empire  and the life of Prophet, as well as the construction of  the cathedral.  The building has a special wing for the archbishops  and the pope to live in, as well as another wing for the  Inquisitorium, which looks more like a barracks than a  typical religious building.  Sanctified Catacombs  Under the cathedral, accessed by a secret entrance  known only to the Pope, his archbishops and well as the  High Templar, are the Sanctified Catacombs, a place  where people of their ranks are buried upon death. Sto -  ries have it the Prophet’s body was been buried there  when the cathedral was still in construction.  The cathedral is a destination for pilgrimage for no -  bles and bishops alike. Sadly the common folk cannot  afford to leave work duties aside to make the trip to  Prophet’s Landing and back.  Holy Symbols  The Church of the Creator has some holy items that  anyone recognizes for their religious meaning.  Spear  The spear is pictured in many paintings of Prophet and  his apostles fighting off witches. This weapon was the  best the slaves could afford back then, requiring less  metal and work than a sword or mace. Many Templars  and monster hunters still carry spears today.  Silver  Due to its deadly efficiency against witches, silver holds  a special place for the Church. For this reason, most  religious ornaments are made of silver in contrast with  nobles’ ornaments which are generally made of gold.  Fire  Witches are executed by a vast array of violent methods;  beheading, drowning, and much more. But the most  prevalent method of putting a witch to death is through  fire. Pyres are erected in public places to which witches  are tied up to them and then lit. The fire is believed  to purify the corrupted soul before putting a life to an  end. Therefore, the fire is considered a holy symbol, to  the point each priest wields an amulet representing fire.  Each religious site, whether it is a grand church to the  most humble shrine will have some kind of brazier that  is burning all day long. The one at the Cathedral of the  Holy Flame is an imposing one, and special oils burn -  ing inside give it a silver colored flame.  Inquisition  Since the fall of the empire, the Church has prepared  itself for the eventuality of witches coming back from  the wilderness but never actually had to face them, at  least up until now. It all started when Arthur Vanar, in -

Inquisition Chapter 3: Religion  16  heritor of the throne of Theavan, was found dead. His  chest was carved with symbols that were identified as  witchcraft. Templars went and found evidence that one  of the prince’s servants, a young maiden was indeed a  witch. She was burned before all the people. Her fam -  ily, who opposed it and denied to have known anything  about witchcraft, were all hanged on the public place,  accused from hiding a witch in their home.  A few days after, another case came up, followed by  another one. Over the course of a month, more than  one hundred presumed witches were executed all over  Eguras. Were they all witches? That is what the Church  claims.  Since then, people are fearful, keeping a close eye on  their neighbors, while trying to lay low. More women  were sent to the church to join the sisterhood, their  fathers fearing that they would be wrongly accused  of witchcraft, bringing dishonor or maybe even death  upon the family.  Recently, a man capable of witchcraft was found and  executed (see   “Warlocks” on page 19 ). The fact that  men could be witches had the Church even more on  guard, and the fear in people’s heart only grew bigger.  Holy Teachings  History is recorded within manuscripts and scrolls held  by Church, and the clergy is the guardian of knowledge.  Peasants and serfs, who represent more than 90% of the  population, are illiterate for the most part and thus can -  not access these writings. In a world where history is  held by a restricted group of people, it is reasonable to  question whether the priests are telling the truth, or if  the content of these books are actually reflecting what  really happened; Prophet, Lilithia, the Creator...  Are these really facts or just the greatest lie of hu -  manity? No one will ever know for sure. People either  lack access to the information, the knowledge and edu -  cation to analyze it or the time to spare. People simply  follow the flow. After all, it is not like an individual,  even a ruler, could fight the Church on their own. Op -  posing the Pope would mean a straight ticket to Lili -  thia’s domain.  In fact, most people do not even question religion  and simply worship the Creator, finding comfort in the  sermons, guidance and promise of a happy afterlife,  and hoping not to be found guilty of heresy.  Pagan Beliefs  While the Church of the Creator is the most wor -  shipped religion, few others exist. Not all people were  as close to Prophet when Lilithia died and people came  up with their own beliefs.  People from Druya and Beraug believe that after  death, the spirit lingers in the world to help their loved  ones, offering spiritual guidance and comfort.  To benefit from the guidance of their ancestral  guardians, the people must act honorably. Also, a dis -  honorable character would not join their ancestors  upon death. Instead, they would linger in a dark meta -  physical space called the   Underworld, in which they  are eternally imprisoned, and doomed to be forgotten.  Female Characters  At first glance, it may seems like female charac -  ters are restricted in their options, as the Church  has an history of acting in a sexist way, not al -  lowing them to rise up in the hierarchy.  Sexism is a perennial problem. Not easy to solve  universally, but in this case it is very much a case  of “removing these aspects would undermine  important themes of the setting.” The world of  Inquisition   is not meant to be pleasant, but the  players can, and perhaps should, fight to chal -  lenge this status quo as Queen Meriel of Trimira  did and create a better world.  With the recent events, the Church has opened  the templar and priestess ranks to women, mak -  ing both female and male characters viable.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches   17  Chapter 4:   Witches  P eople capable of using dark magic, witches are  something to be afraid of. Using effigies, hex bags,  cauldrons and such items, they can unleash powerful  curses and other fearsome effects.  Origin  Magic came to Sondara when   Lilithia took form on the  planet. Her cosmic essence allowed her to use some  power unknown to mankind so far; magic. As she  proclaimed herself as a witch, that magic was quickly  named witchcraft.  Passing the Gift  Witchcraft is a gift that is passed through blood. There -  fore, only ones who have Lilithia as their ancestor can  access witchcraft. Contrary to what was believed for  hundreds of years, witchcraft is not female-exclusive.  What is true though is that only women are capa -  ble of passing the gift. So while a female witch might  give birth to male witches, these men will not produce  witches, unless the mother of the children is also a  witch.  Despite the fact that witch mothers can give birth to  males, the birth rate seems to go in favor of females.  This leads to having more female witches than male  ones. The Church is aware of that fact. Therefore, the  priests try to keep an eye on families with more daugh -  ters than sons.  Lost in Blood  Although magic is a gift that passes on from generation  to generation there are cases when many generations of  witchborn families may never become actual witches.  Sometimes, a witch will not teach their children to  use magic. This may be the case if they died before  their children reached emotional maturity to use it, or  maybe the parent abandoned their child out of fear or  obligation, like from adultery.  When that happens, it can take a few generations be -  fore one of the descendants actually discovers witch -  craft but from that point, they could teach witchcraft to  all of their family.  Manifestation  Everyone descending from Lilithia has the potential to  be a witch. Still, not all these people actually become  full-fledged witches. Many of them will live and die  without knowing they had this ability inside them.  There are three ways for such a person to discover their  potential.  First, the magic can be taught by another witch. It  could be the potential witch’s parent or another witch.  Since witches must be careful about not getting discov -  ered, they tend to not teach how to use the magic un -  less they can be sure that they will be able to stay hid -  den. For this reason, it is pretty rare for a witch to teach  a young child as they are emotionally less stable and  more likely to get caught. Investigation could lead to  the teacher and this is a risk most witches will not take.  Second is exposure to the supernatural. Being ex -  posed to something unnatural, such as witnessing ei -  ther a magic spell, a supernatural creature or even a  witch burning can awaken a person’s inner witchcraft.  Finally, strong emotions can also reveal a person’s  power. Negative emotions such as hate, rage and be -  trayal are the most likely to awake the magic.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches  18  Witches in Society  People blessed (or cursed) with the blood of Lilithia  have to be extra careful within society. Once they real -  ized they are capable of magic, they are drawn to use  it to make their life easier. In a society where they face  harsh conditions, cruel lords and brigand activities, it is  tempting to use supernatural powers to get rid of a rival  or improve their own condition somehow.  Since society, and mostly religion, has associated  witchcraft with evil, witches must be careful to not get  caught. Therefore, they try to restrict themselves from  openly using magic. Fortunately, many of their spells  can help them to stay a step ahead of the inquisition.  For most witches, magic does not affect their am -  bition. Many witches simply want to live a happy life,  have a spouse they could love and have children. But,  like their normal counterparts, some are attracted to  power and these witches are really good at getting into  the important spheres of society due to their magic.  At some point in a witch’s life, they are likely going  to be discovered. Should that happen and if they man -  age to escape being executed, witches mostly use their  polymorph magic to acquire a new appearance and  start a new life.  Those who cannot handle the stress of living in civi -  lized society, full of eyes that may uncover their secret  lineage, will leave it to make their home in the wilder -  ness. These witches tend to choose inhospitable and re -  mote locations to keep curious people at bay. Therefore,  many exiled witches can be found in swamps, moun -  tain caverns and underground.  Lifespan  Witches’ blood confers them an extended lifespan. In  fact, unless they fall ill or are killed, witches can mostly  live indefinitely. For those living in society, this re -  quires the use of magic. Once they are old enough to  be expected to die, they generally vanish, change their  appearance with polymorph spells to assume a younger  appearance, and pass as a completely different person.  Old witches have usually lived long enough, with mul -  tiple identity changes, to see the rise and fall of multiple  rulers.  Covens  Since it is mostly a family thing, most witches tend to  personally know others with the same abilities; their  mother, siblings and children. When witches live to -  gether or gather frequently, it is called a coven. Due to  family structure, a coven generally means a gathering  of all the witch members of a family.  Sometimes, unrelated witches become aware of each  other’s existence. Banding together is a risky but not  uncommon practice for witches. Covens including  multiple families are able to share even more knowl -  edge and power as they can combine their efforts to  achieve more potent spells.  Witches and Evil  While Lilithia is the equivalent of Earth’s Satan and  witches would mostly be the equivalent of demons, not  all witches are actually evil. Witchcraft itself is not evil,  despite what the Church claims.  Sadly, being a witch generally leads to a downward  spiral to evil. Being able to use magic leads to actually  using it. This leads to suspicion from the Church and  being tracked down. Survival against the inquisition  will likely lead to either getting caught or to murder  hunters and templars. And once you killed and real -  ize you get away with it, you are more likely to commit  such an act again.  Still, some witches really want to avoid becoming a  “spawn of evil”. Since most of the spells in their arsenal  are dark and grim in nature, they serve few purposes  for a would-be good witch. Therefore, these “white  witches” as they call themselves try to avoid using mag -  ic whenever possible.  The Church do not take chances with these so-called  white witches and judges that magic is inherently evil  and put every witch down, regardless of their nature  and intents.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches   19  Warlocks  Since the fall of the Midnight Empire, the Church, as  well as all people, always thought that witchcraft was a  women’s thing. This justified the “men only” policy of  the religious organization. Some recent events ,howev -  er, concluded in the discovery of a male witch, known  as warlock.  Five years ago, King Ilthuryn of Trimira died under  suspicious circumstances. Needless to say, inquisitors  were brought in but failed to find the murderer, even  though signs of witchcraft were found. Prince Llewel,  who was one year short of age, could not be crowned  yet. Therefore, it came to Queen Meriel to take over the  throne. Her short reign was far more pleasing for the  population, as she was less corrupted by power than  her husband.  A year later, she had to step aside to let her son Llew -  el rule the kingdom. Llewel was an arrogant and cruel  ruler, taking advice mostly from Tarron, the court’s  bishop, with no regard for his mother. Meriel investi -  gated the bishop, hoping to find something of the man’s  true agenda, or even evidence to remove him from  court. What she found was even more surprising. The  bishop was indeed a warlock. She witnessed him prac -  ticing a magic ritual. After gathering proof, she made a  trip to Prophet’s Landing and went through to the pope  directly.  Responding to the accusation, High Templar Simon  Velton personally investigated the case. The bishop was  found guilty of witchcraft, arrested and put to fire after  a torture session in which the Inquisitorium tried to get  more information about warlocks. Sadly, they did not  learn anything from him.  With the bishop out, Llewel became even more un -  controllable and soon enough, he had his own mother  arrested for treason as she opposed his decision to raise  taxes even more. After being locked and beaten for  days, he brought her out to the public place to execute  her. But the people remembered how much of a bet -  ter ruler she was. During the execution ceremony, the  people’s unrest led them to take arms. They captured  Llewel and freed Meriel. Even some of Llewel’s guards  turned against him. Later that day, Llewel was execut -  ed as per Meriel’s order, burned as a witch for, as she  claimed, his soul was corrupted by the former bishop.  Since then, Meriel became the rightful owner of the  kingdom and she brought back peace to her people.  Dark Speech  The Dark Speech is the tongue of witchcraft. Formulas  and incantations are spoken in this complex tongue.  Its syllables are both sophisticated and guttural at the  same time, depending on the word. This forbidden lan -  guage has a genetic origin, its knowledge transmitted  through blood. When a witch realizes they are capable  of witchcraft, that tongue is naturally learned as if it was  genetic memory.  While it is possible for anyone to learn to read and  speak the Dark Speech, that does not allow for witch -  craft. Aside from witches themselves, templars and  priests tend to learn the basics of this vile language so  they can recognize magical inscriptions and formulas.  Witches and Warlocks  Warlocks, or male witches, are a recent addi -  tion to the people’s folklore. Therefore, the term  “witches” is dominant when addressing a group  of individuals that includes both witches and  warlocks.  Furthermore, throughout this document, the  term “witch” may designate a witch or warlock.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Supernatural Beings  20  Chapter 5:   Supernatural  Beings  Exposure to Magical Energies  M agic is in the blood that all witches share. Each  time a spell is cast, some magical energy lingers  even though the spell’s effects ended. When a witch is  killed, their magic is freed from their body and persists  where they died.  Exposure to magical energies can have a lasting im -  pact on all life forms. Fortunately for the slaves of the  ancient Midnight Empire, the lingering magical ener -  gies were weak at best and their impacts were mostly  harmless.  But when Prophet killed   Lilithia, all her magic filled  the landscape, hitting everyone who survived the war.  Prophet felt the threat to his people and led them away  to safety.  Mutations  Years may have passed but Lilithia’s magic still fills the  ruins of the crumbled empire and is as strong as it was  on the day she died.  Being exposed to the energies for a prolonged time  corrupts the body and soul. Normally, a brief exposure,  like delving into the Midnight Empire ruins for a day or  two, might spare the adventurers but there is no guar -  antee. The effects are unpredictable and different from  one person to another.  Humans tend to become feral, lose their intelli -  gence and revert back to primal instincts. Their bod -  ies are changed into aberrations; additional limbs, eyes,  mouths, etc. The more energy they are exposed to, the  more horrific and unsettling the form. For those who  only have been slightly exposed, minor changes can oc -  cur, and the corrupted humans can sometimes pass as  normal beings. Even in this case, their mind is afflicted.  While they could retain their intelligence, their soul is  most likely filled with evil energy and intent.  Animals and insects tend to grow fiercer. Their natu -  ral weapons are improved and their whole body tends  to grow bigger and more resilient. Some even develop  a superior intelligence, turning them into super preda -  tors.  Many plants will wither after prolonged exposure to  magic, but that is not always the case. Some plants will  grow in size or change and become more dangerous;  growing poison fruits or unleashing toxic spores. Final -  ly, some plants are given some semblance of sentience  and can move and hunt animals and unwary travelers.  Mutations do not always grant powers and capabili -  ties to the life forms they corrupt. Sometimes, people  and animals can simply fall sick and die in pain as their  body stop functioning properly.  Many corrupted animals and humans are unique and  are unable to produce offspring. Even two individuals  being exposed at the same time for the same period  might produce completely different creatures.  Beyond physical transformations that are obvious,  supernatural beings have increased lifespan and, in  certain cases, their metabolism will not follow the same  rules anymore; some creatures may live the rest of their  life without the need for sleep, other might have an un -  limited appetite, and so on.  Silver Anathema  Beside mutations, Lilithia’s essence has another dras -  tic effect on the corrupted. The mutation carries Lili -  thia’s weakness: silver. This metal is the anathema of the  mother witch, and the same goes for every corrupted  creatures. Should silver touch the blood of a creature,  or the chlorophyll of corrupted plants, a supernatural  reaction occurs and is felt throughout the body. For the  corrupted, this feels as if their blood is literally boiling

Inquisition Chapter 5: Supernatural Beings   21  inside their body. Unfortunately for those who would  like to expose themselves to nefarious beings, a mere  contact with the body is not enough though. A templar  or inquisitor cannot simply shake hands with people  while wearing a silver ring and hope for a reaction  should they touch a witch.  Even wounding a witch with a silver weapon would  not necessarily reveals her nature as some of them can  keep their composure and hide how much they as suf -  fering from the silver touching their blood.  For this reason, everyone expected to deal with  witches and these supernatural beings should arm  themselves with an alchemical silver weapon. Since  these weapons are less efficient overall than their steel  counterpart, even these people, mostly templars and  monster hunters, tend to keep a steel weapon handy to  deal with mundane humans and animals.  The   Damned  While the exposure to Lilithia’s energy can create a lim -  itless variety of vile creatures, the Church has catego -  rized few of them as the Damned. These are humans  who were corrupted but retained their consciousness.  Therefore, they are knowingly witnessing their own  degradation. According to the Church, these people  have their soul corrupted to the point they will not join  with the Creator upon their death or destruction.  Needless to say, the Damned are as hunted as the oth -  er creatures. They tend to be even more dangerous than  their feral counterpart as they can pass for humans and  integrate into society.  Grave Walkers  Once a human has been exposed to Lilithia’s essence,  generally through witchcraft or interaction with any  supernatural being, they run the risk of bearing the  grave walker’s curse. Upon their death, their soul will  not leave their body. It grows corrupted overnight and  at next dusk, their body is reanimated into this aberra -  tion of unlife called the grave walker.  Grave walkers are undead, as their metabolism ceases  to function normally. They are animated by the Mother  Witch’s essence and do not need to maintain their body  like living beings. A newly awakened grave walker is  physically indistinguishable from their previous life.  Then, over the course of the following month, their  skin loses its color and they become pale. Their hair  turns either black or white and their eyes are clouded  by white veil.  Unlike other kinds of the Damned, grave walkers  cannot spread the curse effectively. A human exposed  to a grave walker has the same chances to contract the  curse as it if was any other corrupted creatures.  For   those   actively   tracking   supernatural   beings,  namely templars and monster hunters, the risk of be -  coming a grave walker upon death is bigger than for the  rest of the population. To prevent this aberrant trans -  formation, the Church has liquid silver cast into the  mouth of the deceased. Since this practice is expensive,  it is reserved for important and wealthy people such as  nobles and bishops. Templars on the other hand carry  a spiked silver medallion. Upon their death, their com -  rades insert the medallion inside the mouth of their  fallen friend. Should the body revive as a grave walker,  the spikes would puncture the creature’s throat and the  grave walker would die quickly. While this ritual will  not save the soul, it prevents the dead body from be -  coming a spawn of Lilithia. Monster hunters tend to  lack companions most of the time, preventing them  from using such countermeasure.  Despite all this, being inflicted by the grave walker  curse is a rare event and most people, even those who  actively confront the supernatural beings, find a restful  death.  Since they are tracked by the Church and monster  hunters alike, most grave walker live recluse in the wil -  derness. Still, some of them are resourceful enough to  hide themselves into settlements, using heavy garments  and makeup to hidden their true nature.  Werewolves  Stories of these shape shifting creatures date from four  hundreds years ago, when a werewolf attempted to take  over the northern land of Druya.  According to the local stories, a warrior named In -  gvar Dahlen was bitten by a corrupted wolf that climbed  down the Midnight Mountains. The man turned into a  werewolf three days after during the full moon and he  slaughtered most of his village. When he became aware  of his situation, he embraced the curse and tried to take  over the land. He would have succeeded, if the Church

Inquisition Chapter 5: Supernatural Beings  22  had not stopped him. The Church supports the fact  that this man was the first werewolf ever, and that all  living werewolves have either been infected by him, or  are his descendants.  The affliction is passed through wounds caused by  the werewolf ’s teeth and claws. Once a person is in -  fected, they will turn into hybrid form on the next  full moon. At that time, they will revert to a predatory  mindset and prey upon as many humans and animals  as possible, feeding off the corpses. As dawn comes,  they revert back to their human form, without memo -  ries of their transformation.  With time, werewolves realize they are afflicted and  will gain control over their body, allowing for voluntary  transformation. Even for these seasoned werewolves,  the call of their inner beast is stronger than their hu -  manity and they are prone to transforming into ani -  mals whenever they are threatened, wounded or expe -  riencing strong emotions.  Due to their unpredictable transformations, were -  wolves avoid cities, preferring to live in packs in the  wilderness.  Of all the Damned, they are the only ones capable  of breeding, creating natural werewolves. These were -  wolves offsprings can be troublesome for the parents,  as they will change during full moon nights but will  not become aware of their nature until they reach emo -  tional maturity. Fortunately for their mother, they do  not transform before birth.  Vampires  Vampires are the most feared of the Damned. These  creatures are capable of infiltrating the society perfect -  ly, preying in the dark while avoiding detection.  Vampires appeared not long after Lilithia’s death,  leading to think that exposure to her lingering essence  was enough to turn someone into these creatures of the  night.  Vampirism is spread through blood. To turn a hu -  man into a vampire, a vampire must conduct to a blood  exchange. This takes effect when the human drinks the  vampire’s blood, and the vampire drinks the human’s.  Since vampires value their secrecy, they are not looking  to spread the affliction more than they feel necessary.  In fact, most victims are actually volunteers.  Sometimes, a vampire bonds with a human, whether  it be a lover or a close friend. Transmitting the afflic -  tion might be the only way to save someone from a  disease from which they would inevitably die or sim -  ply to avoid the passing of time. Therefore, the human  voluntarily proceeds to the blood exchange, knowingly  becoming a vampire.  At their core, a vampire is an undead. Upon trans -  formation, their metabolism stops and Lilithia’s magic  takes over. Vampires do no age and are immune to  human illnesses. Their facial features tend to become  more alluring upon transformation. They also develop  a set of abilities that makes them good at manipulating  people, as well as being stealthy. These combined abili -  ties make them extremely dangerous and allow them  to climb up the social ranks while avoiding the inquisi -  tors’ detection.  Stories about vampires give them a bunch of abili -  ties and characteristics but most of them are actually  made up tales. Here are some facts that the Church has  observed:  •   Sunlight is deadly to vampires, though they can  cover themselves to get out during daytime.  •   While they can rest, vampires do no need to sleep  and when they do, they do not need a coffin.  •   Garlic has no more effect on vampires than on hu -  mans.  •   They can enter a house uninvited.  •   A vampire can be killed in combat without the  need of a wooden stake, though this method is  very effective.  •   Vampires do drink blood with the help of their  prominent canines.  •   Ancient vampires have shown to have developed  telepathic abilities.

Inquisition Chapter 6: Factions   23  Chapter 6:   Factions  T he Church and the Inquisitorium are not the only  organizations around Eguras. While they are less  important in size, some other groups play a role in the  grand scheme of events.  Here is a brief description of the other factions of the  world.  Midnight Cult  Even though Lilithia was defeated and is known for  enslaving the world, some people were willingly work -  ing with her, enforcing her cruel laws. When the em -  pire crumbled, these people had to flee to avoid getting  killed during the rebellion.  Still, some managed to come back afterward, pass -  ing for survivors and helped building the settlements.  Their devotion and worshipping of Lilithia survived  the years and generations. Even today, there are people  that think Lilithia is a better figure of worship than the  Creator.  The cult is spread thin around the world. Here and  there are secret hideouts, when the cultists gather to  worship their “goddess”.  It is hard to tell for sure how big the cult is as each cell  ignores the locations of others. In fact, the Midnight  Cult hierarchy is similar to feudalism, but in which a  vassal would be unaware of their lord’s location, posi -  tion in the hierarchy as well as the presence of other  vassals.  Each cult cell is led by a leader, called a Hand. Infor -  mation is passed down to Hands by a superior called  a Scion. It is unknown how many Hands reports to a  single Scion, but the Church estimates this number to  be around ten. It is unknown exactly for the time being  how deep that hierarchy stretches, but the investiga -  tions the Church has led so far seem to indicate that  the grand leader of this whole organization is called the  Specter.  Midnight Cult activities are basically anything that  sabotages the Church’s efforts. This includes hiding  witches, blackmailing religious figures, infiltrating the  government to corrupt nobles, and murdering inquisi -  tors and templars.  Monster Hunters  The recent sightings of horrific creatures has created  a need for a specific type of soldier, strong willed and  brave enough to face these atrocities.  While not technically an organized group, monster  hunters sometimes come together to fight off dark  creatures. When they meet each other, they trade in -  formation about their experience and the kind of crea -  tures they fought.  Monsters hunters are somewhat easy to identify as  they wield the same silvery weapons as the templars.  The need for mobility and stealth generally makes them  wear lighter armor while the templars love to show off  in their brilliant ornamented plate armor.  Monster hunting is a hard job, and also one that does  not come with a big workload. There is not always to a  monster to fight everyday, yet monster hunters have to  make a living. Most of them double up as mercenary  soldiers, taking any other jobs that pay well. For this  reason, monster hunters can be seen as a noble’s elite  guard, a sword for hire or even a brigand.  Monster hunting is a discipline originating from  the   Wroven   kingdom.   For   more   information,   see  “Dolumeniro” on page 38 .

Inquisition Chapter 7: Timeline  24  Chapter 7:   Timeline  E guras has a history that spans about 650 years. Here  are the majors events that took place over these  years, from the reign of Lilithia to the present day.  Inquisition   shares the same calendar as Earth. Thus, it  uses the same months and days’ names and a year lasts  the same time as the Gregorian calendar.  -???   Lilithia takes over the continent and establishes  the Midnight Empire, enslaving humankind.  -20   Birth of Prophet.  -1   Prophet receives the vision of the Creator. He  incites rebellion among the slaves.  0   Lilithia is defeated at the hands of Prophet at  the top of the Midnight Tower. Prophet and his  apostles travel to the west and establish Proph -  et’s Landing. Slaves fleeing the mountains start  to colonize the western regions of Eguras.  1   The construction of the Cathedral of the Holy  Flame begins at Prophet’s Landing.  2   Prophet dies.  9   In the northern region of Eguras, the first sum -  mit takes place, gathering all the clans’ jarls to -  gether, thus founding the Druya kingdom.  14   Priests from Prophet’s Landing come to the east -  ern Eguras to preach among the settlements.  16   The Church makes a deal with Lerth Atkinson,  a village leader from this region. The Church of -  fers its support to ascertain his rulership over  the region in exchange of a tithe.  17   Lerth moves to Bacre, the town that will become  the capital of the Aslata kingdom.  19   Atkinson’s influence spreads across the region  and the kingdom of Astala is founded as he  crowns himself king.  30   A merchant finances an expedition to explore  the   uncharted   lands   northwest   of   Prophet’s  Landing that will eventually form Fegary.  63   Jarl Brit Vennerod from Druya claims to have  received a vision from her ancestors. That vision  leads her to the northwest region of Eguras that  will form Beraug later.  64   The first settlement in Beraug, Owl’s Roost, is  founded. The jarl has a second vision showing  an island off the shore. She slowly organizes her  people to get there.  74   Jarl Brit Vennerod leads an expedition to Frost -  more. There, they establish a colony.  79   A merchant ship from the main land reaches out  for the colony in Frostmore to resupply them  with resources. The ship finds the colony com -  pletely deserted and its habitants have mysteri -  ously vanished.  80   Lady Thea Vanar from Astala leads an expedi -  tion through Ranger’s Pass to explore the south -  ern region past the mountain range. There they  settle in the great plains.  110   The Theavan region is flourishing, being a main  supplier for the Astala Kingdom.  197   The Church sends priests in the northern region  of Druya, preaching their beliefs.  200   A holy war is declared between Astala and  Druya as the jarls resist the preaching.  206   Ingvar Dahlen, a werewolf in the nord, starts  challenging the jarls and slowly takes over the  kingdom clan by clan.  228   The Church makes a deal with the jarls of Druya,  offering help defeating the werewolf in exchange  for letting it build a church in their kingdom  and stopping the war. Dahlen is captured and  executed. Church construction starts in Elgund  village. War between Aslata and Druya ends.  254   War between Fegary and Astala starts as Astala  claims territory beyond their borders.  283   People from the Theavan region stopped sup -  porting the Astalan king and claim their inde -  pendence. This deprives the Astalan troops from  their main supplier.  285   War between Fegary and Astala ends with the  latter failing to claim the land.  313   The construction of the Cathedral of the Holy  Flame is completed at Prophet’s Landing.

Inquisition Chapter 7: Timeline   25  322   The people living in the southern region of Egu -  ras are plagued, throwing the Wroven kingdom  into civil war as two pretenders, Aleratha and  Nindrol, fight for the throne.  367   The Wroven civil war ends with a part of the  kingdom splitting up and forming Trimira.  386   Theavanish   scouts   explore   the   southwestern  part of Eguras and meet the witch-led people of  Ranie.  387   The pope launches a crusade against the Ranie  nation.  389   Vanasha, Ranie’s witch ruler is executed and the  lands are divided among the kingdoms. The un -  rest grows among the natives as their goods and  resources are taken over.  496   The treaty of Vanas is signed at Prophet’s Land -  ing. The Ranie nations become the Republic of  Vanas.  550   Fegary expends to the Siven region and ruins are  found. The king forbids their exploration, fear -  ing they are witch-related and filled with dan -  gerous magical energies.  552   Duke Rupert Moore of Fegary sends tomb raid -  ers in the ruins to bring back knowledge about  a previous civilization living on the shores ages  ago. Studying the relics allowed the construction  of superior ships. The duke starts building up a  fleet.  571   Duke Moore now has an armada and the king  of Fegary orders the duke to surrender it. Upon  denial, an internal war begins.  578   The duke blockades the trade ports of Fegary.  586   The king of Fegary surrenders a portion of  the kingdom to the duke as the Siven treaty is  signed.  633   The Siven kingdom sends an expedition on  Frostmore island and establishes a small settle -  ment.  635   Following Siven, Beraug sends a new expedition  to settle on Frostmore island.  641   Pope Abraham VIII is nominated.  642   Arthur Vanar, inheritor of the Theavan’s throne  is found dead. Investigation leads to witchcraft.  Witch sightings have increased over the past  few years. This event triggers the   Inquisition ,  leading to many witches and innocents being  executed.  644   King Ilthuryn of Trimira is murdered. Investi -  gation reveals signs of witchcraft but the witch  cannot found. Queen Meriel is nominated as the  steward for a year, after which her son Llewel  will take over.  645   Llewel is crowned king of Trimira. He is un -  der the influence of the court’s bishop, Tarron.  Meriel exposes Tarron’s warlock powers to the  Inquisitorium. Tarron and Llewel are executed  as Meriel is proclaimed new ruler of Trimira.  Following this event, Queen Meriel demands  a purge of the Church as it may hold several  witches in their ranks. At first, the Church tried  to shut the fact up, even claiming that a witch  might be behind the intrigue and could have  manipulated the bishop. As she persisted in her  demands, Pope Abraham VIII threatened her  with excommunication should she not stop the  unrest.  646   Queen Meriel rallies supporters and decides to  march upon Prophet’s Landing. Rallying some  troops in the Republic of Vanas, Theavan and  Fegary, her army marches upon the holy land.  The Pope is left with the choice of putting his  threat to execution or surrender to the queen’s  demand. Unsure of how many kingdoms would  side by the queen should he decide to continue  with the conflict, the pope invites the queen as  she neared the holy city to discuss and settle the  incident without any bloodshed. The conclu -  sion was that the Church recognizes witchcraft  as being a power that even men can wield and  that magic is so mysterious that this fact passed  through the Church’s vigilance. The queen also  demanded that the organization opens their  ranks to women, which the Pope obliged. The  queen returned to Trimira and the war was  avoided.  647   Since the start of the Inquisition five years ago,  warriors have been training and promoted into  templars each year. This year is the first that in -  cluded female recruits.  648   The first sister is promoted to priestess in Proph -  et’s Landing and is relocated in a Trimiranish  church. The event is celebrated all around Egu -  ras.  649   Present Day.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  26  Chapter 8:   Gazetteer  Sondara  S ondara is the planet on which   Inquisition   takes place.  It is about the same size as real-life Earth. Its climate,  water and surface are also of comparable proportions.  Sondara also has a single moon.  Eguras  Eguras is the continent the setting focuses on and it rep -  resents the known world for the people that live there.  It spreads about two thousands kilometers, which  makes it bit less than one third of the size of Europe.  When people fled the Midnight Mountains, they  traveled west until they reached the open land and  looked for suitable locations to settle.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   27  Kingdoms of Eguras  Over the following centuries, nine kingdoms were es -  tablished all across Eguras. These are Astala, Beraug,  Druya, Fegary, The Republic of Vanas, Siven, Theavan,  Trimira and Wroven.  In addition, there is the single city-state named  Prophet’s Landing, where the Cathedral of the Holy  Flame stands.  Astala  Name  Astala means “Land of Light” in the slave tongue. The  name was chosen to emphasize the contrast with the  Midnight Empire, promising a better life on the land  Prophet showed the people.  Terminology  People:   Astalan  Adjective:   Astalan  Origin  When people fled the Midnight Mountains, many fol -  lowed Prophet in his search for a place to settle. Af -  ter days of travel, a portion of the people that grew  exhausted decided to stop where they stood to build  themselves a new life even though the Prophet wanted  to go further west.  Therefore, along the Midnight Run River, a fair num -  ber of small encampments sprouted. At first, all these  settlements were independent, each functioning as  tribes under the guise of a small group of elders.  Over time, these little communities grew and needed  more resources. As they expanded, they started to con -  test each other’s territory. Conflicts occurred as com -  munities were raided and pillaged for resources and to  acquire the land.  Meanwhile, preachers from well-established Proph -  et’s Landing came back to the eastern lands to tell them  that the holy city have been founded, and that they were  there to offer Creator’s blessings to save their soul from  the grasp of Lilithia. In this troubled time, the Church  gained parishioners easily and shrines to the Creator  started to appear here and there.  It did not take long before the Church actually took  part in the region’s inner politics. One of the villages  had a leader named Lerth Atkinson that the Church  had a good relationship with. They made an under -  ground deal with the man in exchange for a tithe, the  Church would let the surrounding communities know  that the man had the Creator’s blessing to rule this land.  Back then, Prophet’s victory over Lilithia was still re -  cent and some elders even witnessed the defeat of the  Mother Witch. Thus, the Church easily drew people to  their side. Before long, Lerth gained in influence and  some communities pledged allegiance to him. It was  only a matter of time before Lerth’s rulership, with the  Church’s aid, expanded to all the settlements of the re -  gion. Lerth proclaimed himself the king of Astala.  Government  Leonard Atkinson is the current king of Astala. The  kingdom uses the cognatic-primogeniture rules since  its foundation centuries ago. Astala’s rulers always  maintained good relationship with the Church. The  king has the bishop present in most official meetings,  ensuring the Church’s support in his decisions.  World Politics  Of all the kingdoms, Astala is the one that maintains  the best relations with the Church. The fact that Proph -  et came into Eguras through this region and that King  Lerth Atkinson was crowned mostly due to the clergy’s  propaganda led the Church to have a firm grip on the  kingdom’s internal affairs. Therefore, Astala has the  greatest cathedrals and churches, as well as the highest  ratio of templars per person.  Astala shares a border with the Druya kingdom.  These two have a history of conflicts dating back to  their foundation. This is due to a difference in belief  as most Druya people have pagan beliefs. Even though

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  28  war was fought and the Church established themselves  within Druya, there is always tension between the two  nations.  Astala had a conflict with Fegary but that was almost  four hundred years ago. Today, the kingdoms are trade  partners.  Even though the independence was declared long  ago, Astala still regards Theavans as unreliable traitors.  Bacre  Population:   10,000  Ruler:   Leonard Atkinson  Rarity Modifier:   -1  Where the Midnight Run River and Lannola Stream  join together once stood the village one Bacrean’s  Crossing, a trade hub to the whole region due to its key  location. The village has been established by a hunter  called Bacrean. First a hunter’s shack, it grew into a  large community over the years, to the point where Le -  rth Atkinson moved there when he crowned himself  king. Spawning on the three riverbends, the city is now  the seat of Astala’s government.  The town is greatly influenced by the Church. It has  a magnificent cathedral, rivaled only by the one in  Prophet’s Landing. The town has many statues depict -  ing local heroes as well as Prophet. People show dedi -  cation for all things religion and participate zealously  in the cult’s rituals, such as praying before meals, go -  ing to the church daily, and most of them have a rep -  resentation of Prophet in their home. Some also have  a silver spear tip hanging above their main door. The  tradition holds that should a witch enters their home,  the Creator would make the cord break and the spear  tip would fall into the witch’s head. Of course, these are  just stories but people find comfort in respecting this  tradition and it shows the Church their devotion.  Beraug  Name  Beraug means “Promised haven” in Notrhal. It refers  to the land Jarl Brit Vennerod hoped to reach follow -  ing the visions she claimed to have received from her  ancestors.  Terminology  People:   Beraugan  Adjective:   Beraugan  Origin  One day, Brit Vennerod, a jarl from Druya claimed to  have received a vision from her ancestors. They told her  that their salvation was to be found to the west and that  staying there will bring them doom. Vennerod brought  the matter to the summit but the other jarls chose to  ignore her warnings.  Still, Jarl Vennerod drove her people, the Owl Clan,  to the west. They traveled to the northwestern coast  where they faced the   Silent Sea. Convinced that their  destination was beyond the coast, they settled there  and started to organize an expedition.  Ten years have passed before the clan was ready to  move out. Vennerod, along with explorers, took to the  sea and landed upon the island of   Frostmore. A colony  was established there, despite the fact it did not look  like the land promised by Vennerod’s ancestors.  Five years later, a ship made the trip between the  mainland and the colony. They found it empty. The  settlement was there but no sign of life. Jarl Brit Venne -  rod was lost at the same time. Her son took over back  on the mainland but decided to refrain from colonizing  Frostmore again. He focused his efforts on securing his  people and colonizing the main land.  Government  When Jarl Brit Vennerod left Druya along her people,  they were not part of its governmental structure any -  more. Up to her death, Vennerod was the uncontested  ruler of the clan. When she passed away and her son  took over, they adapted a system in between the old  ways and feudalism.  On the nation’s scale, Beraug uses feudalism, but the  terminology is different. The ruler is called the High  Jarl. They make world scale decisions by themselves  and are supreme ruler in the kingdom. To help manage  the land, it has been split into domains, which are ruled  by jarls. Finally, the domains are divided into multiple  clan holds, which are headed by clan masters.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   29  Inheritance rules are quite different in Beraug. Dur -  ing their life, the ruler chooses an inheritor. The posi -  tion in the lineage is of no importance as a ruler could  choose his third child to take over after they pass away.  While a ruler generally chooses their own child as suc -  cessor, nothing in the law prevents otherwise.  As with Druya’s laws, it is possible to challenge the  ruler in a duel to claim their title. To engage in such  duel, you need to either be the sibling of the ruler, or  have the support of the majority of the ruler’s vassals.  World Politics  Beraug have been isolated from the rest of the world  year 63 to 550, when they met Fegaryans at their fron -  tiers. Over the following century, the Beraugans have  engaged in trading with Fegary, and even with other  kingdoms through naval routes.  The Church has not declared hostilities toward the  reclusive kingdom as they ended up being open mind -  ed to the preaching. People from Beraug have freedom  of religion within their frontiers. Churches have been  built but not everyone attend. Some of the folk even  accept both religious beliefs as being valid, honoring  their ancestors and the Creator. As long as they do not  disturb the Church’s activities or commit heresy, the re -  ligious organization does not combat the behavior. Yet  the Church still pushes its agenda further to draw more  people in.  Ugltis  Population:   3,000  Ruler:   High Jarl Idirr Vennerod  Rarity Modifier:   +0  Ulgtis means “Owl’s Roost” in Notrhal. Originally a  temporary settlement, Ulgtis served as a shipyard to  prepare for the expedition to Frostmore or Sltudrikal  as the Beraugans call it. When the settlement on the  remote island was lost, the clan established themselves  on the mainland permanently.  The town is built around a hill with steep stopes and  cliffs. Atop the hill stands the Roost, the clan’s great  hall. From there, the Owl Clan’s jarl can survey their  land. The city is loosely populated. Houses are scattered  on different levels of the hill as well as on the plain be -  low, up to the Silent Sea’s coast. Fortifications are placed  at strategic points upon the hill to withstand a siege and  allow soldiers to fall back atop the hill should the pali -  sades be breached.  Goat herding is the main occupation of the towns -  folk and pastures are all around the town. By the coast  lies the town’s shipyard, with its constant movement of  Beraug fishing ships.  Druya  Name  When the people came to the region, they encountered  a large population of bears. Therefore, they named  the land Druya, which means The “Land of Bears” in  Notrhal, Druya’s native language.  Terminology  People:   Druyan  Adjective:   Druyan  Origin  When Lilithia died, all the slaves fled the mountains.  People from the northern region were too far from  the events to realize what happened. They simply  witnessed their witch slavers backing off suddenly as  their link to the Mother Witch faded. Fearing that the  witches would come back one day, they fled the moun -  tains. Those who went west reached the northern part  of Eguras. There, they settled for a new life. Food being  scarce and the climate harsh, they formed little clans  and spread over the snow-covered plains.  Beliefs  Druyans honor their ancestors. They believe that once  a person dies, their spirit lingers in the world and may  provide help to their descendants and loved ones.  Druyans tend to greatly value family heirlooms and  wielding their ancestor’s weapons is common for a clan  master, believing it improves the link between them  and their parent. These beliefs have led to conflicts with  Astala when the priests started to preach their way into  Druya.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  30  Government  Druya does not follow the same feudal structure as the  other kingdoms. Every major settlement of the king -  dom is ruled by a Jarl. While the jarl’s position is passed  down to their child upon their death, the successor is  chosen rather than being the first-born. The jarl makes  sure to choose their most able child to lead the clan  once they are gone.  It is possible for a jarl to lose their title through a chal -  lenge. Anyone can challenge their jarl in a one-on-one  combat. These combats are generally non-lethal but  death may happens and will not invalidate it. Cheat -  ing disqualifies the challenger and gives automatic vic -  tory to the jarl. Should the jarl be the one cheating, this  throws dishonor on their family and the jarl loses their  title in favor of the challenger. Should the challenger  and the jarl did not survive, the elders of the clan will  elect a new jarl. This tradition has led Druya clans to  have strong leaders. Every time a jarl dies and his child  takes their place, there may be a period of time where  the new jarl will have to fight through challenges as  others clan members feel they do not have what it takes  to fill in the position as much as them.  All clans are independent, but for everything con -  cerning the region of Druya and world-politics, the  summit of the jarls takes place. During these events,  which normally take place at twice a year unless spe -  cial circumstances require otherwise, internal warfare  is suspended and the jarls meet and discuss together  to make important decisions. These gathering generally  last few days, where folk from each clan meet. During  these summits, trade takes place, alliances can form  and marriages can be organized and celebrated.  The summit is chaired by the High King of Druya.  Despite the name, this position does not grant ultimate  power over the land. The High King will lead the sum -  mit and serves as a mediator during debates. Finally,  they will break ties when a vote occur on how to resolve  a situation. Like the jarl position, the High King title is  not permanent as it can be revoked with a challenge.  Only a jarl can attain the title of High King of Druya.  World Politics  Druya is isolated from the rest of the world. Their only  immediate neighbors are Astala for which their rela -  tion with them is tense at best, and Fegary. The latter is  a trade partner and through them, the northern king -  dom can access the central trade hub. The relations with  Fegary are better than Astala as they are more focused  on prosperity and trade rather than zeal and religion.  Werewolves  Druya is known to have the first werewolf sighting.  Their proximity to the Midnight Mountains brings  their share of trouble. Druya’s first settlers ignored the  effects of Lilithia’s essence and thus, many lived for  some time in the mountains bordering the Druyan  frontiers. At first, they believed that some disease was  afflicting them and turning them into twisted crea -  tures. Soon enough, they permanently left the moun -  tain range.  As per the Druyan folklore, the first werewolf, Ingvar  Dahlen, was a reclusive hunter living near the moun -  tains. He could have been bitten by a corrupted wolf  that would have transmitted the curse. It took him few  months to become aware but when he did, he became  powerful and ambitious. He challenged the jarl of the  Fox Clan and won. After becoming the new jarl, he  changed the clan’s name for Wolf Clan and bred most  of the clan’s women.  It was a matter of time until his power was exposed to  the people and his clan became feared across the land.  The Wolf Clan won all the conflicts they fought and the  other jarls became weary. The summit was coming in  close and the high king knew that he would be likely  challenged by the werewolf.  The timing was perfect for him when a priest from  Prophet’s Landing came after learning of this werewolf  lord. The priest convinced the jarls that Dahlen’s soul  was corrupted. Having such an aberration ruling Druya  was far too dangerous for its people. The priest offered  that Prophet’s Landing would support the jarls against  the werewolf and would convince Astala to halt the  war. In exchange, a church would have to be built in El -  gund. The jarls secretly gathered before the summit to  discuss the offer. They were concerned that this religion  would shake their culture but with the werewolf taking  over, they could not afford the never-ending war with  Astala and religion was one of its causes so they ended  up agreeing. When the summit took place, a squad of  templars was present in town. When Ingvar showed up,  the Inquisitorium captured him and killed some of his  children as the rest ran for their life. The Church did  put on a show of demonstrating how the werewolf was  a product of Lilithia’s as they beheaded him.  The jarls underestimated the impact of the Church’s  display on the population. Some of the clans convert -  ed to the Church while others fought the aggressive  preaching. In the end, this event split Druya in half,  with the lower part supporting the Church while the  northern villages remains true to their ancestral beliefs.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   31  Elgund  Population:   4,000  Ruler:   High King Stulfri Hurgon  Rarity Modifier:   -1  Elgund means “Elk’s Pound”. The town houses the Elk  Clan, where Jarl Stulfri Hurgon is currently holding the  tile of High King of Druya. The title has been in the  clan for the last three generations, when Horvas Hur -  gon challenged the previous High King.  The Elk Clan is famous for its skilled axe-throwing  warriors. Each summit since it took the crown, an axe-  throwing tournament takes place. That fighting style  grew popular over the last years and it brought the at -  tention of monster hunters in search of new tricks.  The town is surrounded by a strong wooden palisade.  Right beside it stands the lake that gave the settlement  its name. Its fish are one of the main food source for the  town, along with trapping.  Fegary  Name  Fegary means “Plenty of gold” in Slave Tongue. In this  case, the name has a double meaning. It represents both  the amount of resources that were spent to colonize the  region and the income from exploiting the area.  Terminology  People:   Fegaryan  Adjective:   Fegaryan  Origin  Thirty years after the fall of the Empire, Frederick  Hunt, a rich merchant from Prophet’s Landing wanted  to claim a land as his own. Selling his thriving business  to a competitor, he funded an expedition to explore the  northwestern region of the holy city.  The expedition marched down the river until they  found the Whispering Lake. There, they settled a new  village. The community grew as people from both  Astala and Prophet’s Landing joined them, attracted by  Hunt’s promises to grant land to settlers.  Government  Back at its origin, Fegary was managed more as a  business than a kingdom but as the lands were being  granted, the administration became similar. Therefore,  Frederick Hunt crowned himself king of Fegary. The  kingdom uses the cognatic-gavelkind inheritance sys -  tem. When a ruler dies, its primary title goes to their  eldest child, while the other titles are equally shared  among all their children.  World Politics  Fegary is the closest you can get to being the center of  Eguras. Its borders connect to Phophet’s Landing, as  well as every kingdom beside Wroven, Trimira and the  Republic of Vanas, with the latter being easily accessi -  ble through the   Hungry Sea. Therefore, Fegary became  the hub of Eguras’ economy, with merchants from all  around the continent passing through them to buy and  sells their specialties.  Thank to this position, Fegaryans have a privileged  position where they can more easily negotiate with the  other kingdoms. In fact, Fegary has to be the richest  kingdom of Eguras, rivaled only by Prophet’s Landing.  Caslun  Population:   9,000  Ruler:   King Samuel Hunt  Rarity Modifier:   -1  When Frederick Hunt found the Whispering Lake, he  fell in love with the scenery and settled down, deciding  that this will be where his home will stand. Starting as  a humble community, Caslun, from “Castle Hunt”, has  become a prosperous community.  For centuries, Caslun has been the center of Fegary’s  trade activities. Since the discovery of the Republic of  Vanas and the war that split the kingdom into two, the  Hungry Sea has seen an increase in naval activities.  Therefore, a portion of Fegary’s trade activities are now  operated from Port Beream, located directly on the  coast of the Hungry Sea.  Caslun is built along the coast of the Whispering  Lake, where many merchant and fishing ships come  and go at any time of the day. Caslun connects with

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  32  Astala, Prophet’s Landing, Beraug and Druya, routing  their goods to the southern kingdoms through Port  Beream or Theavan across the lake.  Besides trading, the city is rich in artisans, working  exquisite imported metals, woods and textiles from all  around the world. Beyond its walls, the surrounding  plains are filled with crops and pastures. Fegary has a  fair number of horses’ farms as the demand is high for  the merchants’ carriages.  Republic of Vanas  Name  The name Vanas comes from Vanasha, the witch that  ruled the place before the war. To appease the op -  pressed natives, the name of the previous ruler was so  embedded into the republic’s name. Before the founda -  tion of the republic, this region was named Ranie.  Terminology  People:   Vanasian  Adjective:   Vanasi  Even though the term “Vanasian” encompasses both  natives and those that came after the war from around  all Eguras, natives still refer themselves as Ranie. There -  fore, the term stuck. Natives are therefore called Ranie  while even though Vanasian means anyone living in  the Republic, the term is unofficially used to identify  non-native people.  Origin  Contrary to other regions of Eguras, The Republic of  Vanas, called Ranie back then, was already colonized  when Prophet defeated Lilithia, its people living se -  cluded from the world all this time. It is only when  Theavan tried to expand their land that they encoun -  tered the people of Ranie. Theavanish scouts were sur -  prised when they discovered that the people of Ranie  were openly governed by a witch.  Scouts reported the information and it did not take  long before it came to the Pope’s ear. He ordered a dele -  gate of templars and priests to assess the situation. Only  a pair of templars came back from the mission, report -  ing the group were ambushed by Vanasha’s forces. They  barely escaped with their lives as their comrades were  subject to the evil magic of the witch. This act of war  could not be left unanswered and the Pope launched  a   crusade.  All kingdoms participated in the holy war, sending  troops to Ranie to defeat the witch queen. The people  of Ranie, despite being supported by witches, could not  hope the hold against the kingdom’s united efforts. Ra -  nie fell in a matter of few months, and Vanasha was  burned in front of her castle.  Following the victory, the pope rewarded the war ef -  fort by granting conquered lands to each kingdom. The  defeated people were to convert to the Church or be  executed. After a display of power, the people acknowl -  edge the preaching. Churches were built and people  had to listen to the sermons. Resistance was dealt with  harshly by the templars and local troops.  For the following years, each kingdom tried to man -  age their colony from afar, beside Theavan that, as a  neighbor, was able to include their newly claimed land  into their frontier.  The lack of proper means of communication brought  its share of problems. Too far away to be properly man -  aged, the colonies were acting as city states. Having na -  tive people in common, and being isolated from their  respective distant ruler, the colonies ended up helping  each other out more than their motherland has been.  This led them to earn their independence with the  Vanas treaty, signed at Prophet’s Landing back in 496.  From there was born the Republic of Vanas.  Some Vanasha’s loyalists still fight the invader as the  Church takes root in this region of Eguras. Rumors has  it that the   Midnight Cult was founded by the Ranie  people after their witch queen died.  Government  From the start, the colonies were difficult to manage  from afar and the dukes there had to rely mostly on  themselves to deal with the difficulties of occupying  this part of the world. They ended up working together,  forming an entity of their own, made official by the  treaty of Vanas.  All the colonies, beside the one that was claimed by  Theavan, now form the Republic of Vanas. The repub -  lic’s seat is at the city of Obsidia. Each month, a con -

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   33  gress takes place in the Hall of Azure, where the council  members gather and vote on decisions.  There are thirty seats in the council, each granting the  right to vote. To get a seat, one must have obtained the  “Vanas Aristocrat” status, which is a paid privilege. In  addition, council members are elected in their commu -  nities. The Church holds five seats and these are man -  aged directly by the organization rather by the people.  Council members are required to attend a gathering  once per month, and sometimes more often when an  urgent situation occurs. Failing to attend to a meeting  has consequences, from fees to having their seat re -  voked.  Elections take place every three years, and only of -  ficial citizens can vote to elect a council member. Ob -  taining the citizenship is expensive and thus, only the  most successful businesspersons can achieve it. The na -  tive people are stuck being artisans at best and serf at  worst.  World Politics  The republic has its share of internal problems as the  native population is still resisting the occupation de -  spite the efforts to control the unrest. While the inva -  sion took place a few generations ago, the natives are  still oppressed as the more powerful families among  them lost their influence and riches.  Still, the republic holds friendly relations with most  kingdoms, and trades with them by taking advantage of  being surrounded by well traveled seas.  Native Culture  The native people from the region forming the republic  have a different mindset than the rest of Eguras. These  folks had been living under the reign of Vanasha, a  powerful witch that held the throne for generations.  Unlike Lilithia’s reign, the people were not oppressed  and the   Ranie kingdom was prosperous.  Like the people originating from Midnight Moun -  tains, the Ranie are a homogenous population, with  their appearance varying in color and shape. Still, it is  easy to tell a Ranie from someone else as they have a  strong accent when speaking Egurian. In addition, the  Ranie people have a strong tattoo tradition. Every na -  tive bears many tattoos that can cover any part of their  body. The tattoos illustrates the lineage of a person, as  well as the major events and trials of their life. Vana -  sha’s execution, as well as the crusade is commonly rep -  resented in such tattoos.  Midnight Cult  Beside Vanasha, there were a handful of witches that  lived in Ranie prior to the invasion. From what the  Church can tell, these were all women but back then;  they denied the existence of warlocks so they avoided  capture.  The Church suspects that the Midnight Cult, the or -  ganization sabotaging the Inquisitorium’s efforts, origi -  nates from the Ranie. After all, they are the most likely  to befriend witches. Add to this the fact that they are  oppressed in their own lands makes it even more plau -  sible. The Church have failed to find any proof to sup -  port their theory but they suspect Ranie warlocks are  empowering the cult, if not leading it.  Obsidia  Population:   5,000  Ruler:   Councilwoman Almithara Sartris  Rarity Modifier:   +0  Once the seat of the witch Vanasha’s power, Obisidia  now serves as the capital of the republic. Its name was  changed after it was conquered, from Irkehzuth, which  means “In the Old One’s gaze”. No native could explain  the reason behind the city’s name. Instilling discomfort  to the new settlers, the duke that was gifted that land  changed it to Obsidia. The new name was inspired by  Vanasha’s castle. The stronghold standing on top of the  hill, as well as the city fortifications were made of dark  stones looking like they were made of obsidian and  thus the city’s new name was chosen.  The obsidian castle is an impressive structure by it -  self. It has many levels at different heights and some  of the rooms and towers can only be reached through  balconies. For a foreigner, navigating the castle is like  trying to find your way in a hay maze.  The city’s architecture is, like the entire republic, quite  different than what you find elsewhere in Eguras. The  Ranie people were building their cities while avoiding  disrupting the nature inside their walls and Obsidia is  no exception. Houses are built where there is room and  sometimes, even around a tree. The house would thus  have an opening in the ceiling to have the tree sprout  out from the rooftop. Some houses were even built atop  large tree branches. Due to restricted building space,  many houses, even from the poorest families, were  built from two to four stories high. In many cases, dif -  ferent families would share a single building, splitting  the levels between themselves. A home generally has

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  34  one entry per level, those at the top generally accessible  through tree branches or rope ladders.  Over the years, the landscape has been transformed  as the newcomers had a different idea of what a city  this size should be like to be fully functional. A stone  road has been laid out to connect the city’s entries with  the Hall of Azure, the central building hosting the con -  gress. In spite of these transformations, the govern -  ment has tried to keep nature intact within the city as  to not cause unnecessary unrest.  Siven  Name  The name comes from the people that lived in the re -  gion before people from Fegary colonized the area.  When the kingdom was founded, the king took this  name in memory of this past civilization.  Terminology  People:   Siveni  Adjective:   Sivenish  Origin  As Fegary expanded, their frontiers reached the west -  ern part of Eguras. There, they found the ruins of an an -  cient civilization bordering the Bleak Expanse’s coast.  Fearing that the ruins were witch related, the king or -  dered that all were to stay away from them until they  could get the Church to investigate. Still, Duke Rupert  Moore secretly investigated the ruins and discovered  artifacts that lead to improvement in ships construc -  tion. The duke started to build a fleet and at some point,  it came to the king’s attention.  The king ordered the duke to surrender the ships,  which he declined as he had spent resources to build  them. Taking this as an affront, the king’s demoted the  duke. This led the duke sending out his fleet inside the  Hungry Sea and blockaded the Fegary’s naval route to  the Republic of Vanas. The king called to arms his vas -  sals to help reclaim the duke’s land but underestimated  the duke’s influence in this part of Fegary and many  joined side with the duke. After years, the war ended  with the king surrounding a part of the kingdom to the  duke in order to lift the blockade  Government  Despite the change in government, King Moore kept  the cognatic-gavelkind inheritance laws from his for -  mer kingdom. His descendants never changed them  either.  World Politics  Siven have established relations with all the kingdoms  thanks to their ever growing naval fleet. They maintain  particularly good relations with the Republic of Vanas  and Trimira. They show a particular interest in the re -  public’s artifacts, trying to find a link between them  and the civilization that populated the region ages ago.  Their relation with the Beraug kingdom is now tense.  Sixteen years ago, Siven sent an expedition to Frost -  more, the land that Beraug tried to colonize in the  past. When they found out, Beraug warned them that  Siven had no right over the island and that this land  was theirs to claim, even though they did not have an  established settlement themselves on it. The northern  kingdom explained that they were waiting another vi -  sion to attempt to populate the island again but it was  still theirs. Siven refused the demand and now each  side masses troops along their adjoining borders. War  is expected at next sign of disagreement. Two years lat -  er, people from Beraug landed on the northern island  and established their own settlement.  Valcien  Population:   9,000  Ruler:   King Cohen Moore  Rarity Modifier:   -1  Valcien is a great bustling city. Built around the junc -  tion of two rivers, naval activities are omnipresent  as the river bends are filled with docks. From there,  material and goods are ferried to coast, where the fa -  mous Sivenish ships are constantly being built. Incom -  ing goods from abroad enter the city before traveling  throughout the kingdom by carriage.  Outside the city’s stone walls stand the archeological  site of Zavumus. The city got its name from these ru -  ins. When the settlers came to the region, the crumbled  buildings pointed to an ancient civilization and the re -  gion was named Valley of the Ancients. The city was  given a shortened name of the region; Valcien.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   35  The ruins are visible from the city and are guarded  day and night by the king’s men to prevent tomb raid -  ers from pillaging them. That did not prevent unau -  thorized entries from time to time and the city has an  underground market where relics are sold illegally.  Valcien is the main knowledge hub for everything  regarding the ancient civilization. The city has a uni -  versity where the artifacts recovered from all around  the region are studied. It also has a wing that serves as  a museum to display items once they have been studied  thoroughly.  Theavan  Name  The name comes from the name of the woman that led  the expedition to colonize the region, Lady Thea Vanar.  Terminology  People:   Theavani  Adjective:   Thevanish  Origin  As Astala expanded, they found themselves restrained  in between the Midnight Mountains, Prophet’s Land -  ing, Fegary and Druya. But as they were exploring their  own region, they found a passage in between the hills  of the southern mountain range. An expedition was  sent in and revealed a new land suitable for agriculture.  Astala rapidly sent settlers to claim the land.  The first expedition to colonize the land was under  the banner of Lady Thea Vanar, a knight from the king’s  court. She settled the first village and supervised the  colony. The region was full of resources and Astala’s no -  bility was the main party reaping the rewards. The King  grew more demanding over time and the people from  the colony were increasingly taxed to fill the king’s cof -  fers. In spite of this, the colony continued rapid growth  as food was abundant and the land was easily claimed.  As the years passed, their border crossed with oth -  er kingdoms such as Fegary and Wroven. Back then,  there was a war between Fegary and Astala. Astala  kept requiring more resources from the colony but did  not provide troops to defend their border. The colony  ended up turning their back on them, ceasing conflict  with Fegary and stopped resupplying the king’s army.  Even more, they started to trade with the enemy. This  act of treason could not go unpunished and the king  retaliated. But they could not afford the conflict on two  fronts and ended up losing the colony and their claim  on the contested territory.  From there, the colony became a kingdom, giving it  the name of the lady knight that led the first expedi -  tion. After that, Theavan knew prosperity. Their diplo -  matic relations with Fegary were good and even though  there have been attempts from Astala to invade them  through Ranger’s Pass, Theavanish fortifications kept  them at bay.  Government  Theavan use the same cognatic-primogeniture laws  from their mother nation Astala.  World Politics  Relations between Theavan and their former patron  nation are not that great. Many Astalans despise the  Thevani, tagging them as traitor and unreliable.  Their relations are far better with Fegary, with whom  they trade regularly. Like Fegary, Theavan benefits  from an advantageous position at the center of Eguras.  Paired with the most profitable farmlands of the conti -  nent, Theavan is a major player on the world’s market.  Theavan shares part of the same problem as the Re -  public of Vanas regarding natives as a fraction of the  kingdom’s population are Ranie, since part of their land  was included into Theavan. Still, the Ranie natives want  to join back to the Republic to share their people’s fate.  Ashstay  Population:   10,000  Ruler:   King Carson Vanar  Rarity Modifier:   -1  When Theavan was first explored, Lady Thea Vanar  settled in the region where she lived the rest of her life.  The village was first named Thea’s Rest, and then was  shortened to Therst.  Years later, a fire struck the village, burning half of  it. While the threat was gone, the town was covered in

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  36  cinders. Being a centralized location, many merchants  and travelers came through the city the following days,  staying for the night become going further to trade. The  village was then commonly referred to as “the burned  place where you stay before continuing down the road.”  The village was thus renamed Ashstay. It remained the  seat of the Vanar family and even though a portion of  the village burned, the farmlands were still producing.  Aggressive tariffs were imposed for any merchant pass -  ing through this obligatory stop. The good soil quality  paired with the increased money flow and tenacious  settlers have allowed this settlement to rise from the  ashes, transforming the rural hamlet into a self-suf -  ficient hub of trade and grain exporter. The region is  also blessed with a high equine population, making the  town a main provider of mounts for neighboring cities  and kingdoms.  Years have passed since the incident but the town  kept its name. Some buildings dating from that era are  still blackened to this day. Beside this souvenir, the city  is unrecognizable today. The castle has been built atop  a small hill and is visible from anywhere within the  city. Close to it is a military academy, where thevanish  warriors are trained in the art of war. Their specialty is  mounted archery and thevanish skirmish groups are a  force to be reckoned with. Mobile and precise, they can  dispatch larger groups as infantry units with deadly ef -  ficacy.  The artisans’ quarter is a busy place all day, where the  theavani work the hide to make the finest leather prod -  ucts of Theavan. During the war between Astala and  Fegary, the king’s armies were mostly wearing theavan -  ish leather armor and their knights riding their horses.  This came to an end when Theavani rebelled.  Beyond the artisans’ quarter and the high town stand  sturdy wooden fortifications and further away, acres  upon acres of farmlands and pastures.  Trimira  Name  Trimira means “Land of Righteous”. It came from the  army Aleratha led herself during the war, “Trimiteh” or  “The righteous warriors”, referring to her perception of  having a claim to the Wrovenish throne.  Terminology  People:   Trimiranishan  Adjective:   Trimiranish  Origin  Trimira was as its origin part of the Wroven kingdom.  When a plague stroke the land, civil war took place as  the king and his family passed away. The main pretend -  ers to throne were two of the king’s niblings; Aleratha  and Nindrol, both coming from different parents. Al -  eratha united the western wrovenish people under her  banner and fought for the crown. Both parties exhaust -  ed themselves and the plague did not help. Aleratha  and Nindrol ended up resigning themselves to split the  kingdom into two in order to save their people from  further deaths. As the war ended, Trimira was its own  kingdom and could recover from the plague that was  slowly losing ground.  Government  Few years after Trimira became independent; Aleratha  changed the inheritance rules toward cognatic-gavel -  kind, where titles are shared among all children. Aler -  atha thought that it would instill cooperation between  all the inheritors rather than having all of them envy  the firstborn. Also, she did not want to risk placing the  entire kingdom’s power into the hands of someone that  might be flawed.  World Politics  Trimira is known as the symbol of righteousness since  Queen Meriel exposed the first warlock and marched  on Prophet’s Landing. This led to a delicate relation  with the Church. This defiant attitude toward the re -  ligious organization brought the support of the native  people of the Republic of Vanas. Those that can afford  so sometimes move in to Trimira to settle for a new  life, farther away from the Templars that are still pretty  active within the republic.  Varothell  Population:   7,500  Ruler:   Queen Meriel Liafiel  Rarity Modifier:   -1

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   37  Back when Trimira and Wroven were a single king -  dom, Varothell, meaning “Gold Shire” in Wrovenishor,  was a little frontier farming community with only two  hundreds souls. The land was granted to one of the roy -  al family’s relative. The town knew an economic boom  when a gold vein was discovered, leading to a mining  exploitation.  When the plague spread over Wroven, Aleratha Li -  afiel was the baroness of this booming community. As  the royal family was decimated, Aleratha was the next  in line for the succession of the crown. This claim was  contested by her cousin Nindrol whose parent would  have been born few days before hers. Both parties re -  fused to let the other win, and thus conflict erupted.  Even though she was a mere baroness, she had the sup -  port of many counts and her duke. The kingdom went  into civil war. Between the skirmishes and the plague,  both parties were exhausted. They ended up signing a  treaty that both would get a share of Wroven, while sur -  rendering their claim on the other half.  This   treaty   is   the   element   that   made   Aleratha’s  lands an independent kingdom. The counts and duke  pledged allegiance to her and a ceremony took place for  her coronation in Varothell.  By now, the town had expanded thanks to the gold  mine. A castle has been built to house Trimira’s royal  family. The mine is busier than ever with a fair share of  the population working to extract and process its pre -  cious metal. The forges of Varothell are numerous and  kept lit all day long. The marketplace is full of jewelry  on display of various levels of craftsmanship.  The town is also known to be home to Shalheira Leo -  vyre, the first priestess of the Creator. She is taking care  of the city’s cathedral, along with the bishop.  Wroven  Name  The name Wroven means “Shadowlands” in Wroven -  ishor. The name was inspired by the harsh time the  people lived through when first descending from Mid -  night Mountains. The land was an inhospitable swamp  and people thought that Eguras was no better than  the Midnight Empire. Their luck eventually improved  when they marched farther away, but the name stayed.  Terminology  People:   Wrovenishan  Adjective:   Wrovenish  Origin  Since its foundation, Wroven has been isolated from  the world. The people fleeing the Midnight Empire that  ended up to the south of the mountain range were be -  yond Prophet’s Landing influence. One of the slaves,  a man named Kir, showed prowess during the slave  uprising and killed a witch slave master himself. This  display of courage led him to become a leader for the  homeless slaves. Following his guidance, they marched  down the mountain and into in the swamp until they  decided to stop to found a settlement. This man re -  named himself Ilvisar Liafiel and his bloodline became  Wroven’s royal heritage.  In attempt to put the most distance between them  selves and the mountains, Wrovenishans scouted fur -  ther beyond the swamp and found suitable lands along  the Blood Sea’s coast. From there, multiple settlements  were established along the sea. Over the years, Wroven  expanded on most of the southern part of Eguras.  At some point, a plague struck the land. The king,  as well as his children, perished. This threw the king -  dom into unrest as pretenders to the crown fought be -  tween themselves. This civil war lasted for years until  the kingdom split into two and Trimira was founded  as a result.  Monster Hunting  When Eguras was first colonized, the people that  moved into the region of Wroven had a difficult time  settling in. First, they were facing a large swamp area  and lack of food. When the people found farmable land  and finally settled down, they were struck by a plague  that decimated most of the population and threw the  kingdom into civil war. All these years, many Wroven -  ishans gave up the idea that Wroven was a better solu -  tion than staying in the Midnight Empire’s ruins and  decided to go back into the mountains.  This led to an increased number of people being  exposed to Lilithia’s essence and the region knew the  most monster sightings of all Eguras. While monster

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  38  hunting is a practice taking place all around Eguras, it  is most prominent in this part of the world due to in -  creased monster activities. Most techniques to properly  hunt these creatures are developed in Wroven.  Government  Wroven uses the cognatic-primogeniture inheritance  rules. While this has worked well for a long period of  time, the kingdom was shaken during the plague when  all the inheritors died from the disease. Since the war  ended about three hundred years ago, the royal lineage  has suffered no major setback.  World Politics  Wroven is isolated and did not have contacts with the  other kingdoms until most of Eguras was populated.  Now that Wroven became aware of the other king -  doms, they engaged in trade with Trimira, the republic  and other nations they can reach through the Hungry  Sea.  Vinimras  Population:   8,000  Ruler:   Queen Viessa Liafiel  Rarity Modifier:   -1  Years after settling in the swamp near the mountains,  Wrovenish scouts found a suitable land to welcome  their people, promising an easier life. There, on the  coast of the Blood Sea was built Vinimras, or “Salva -  tion of the light”. The village offered a new haven where  people could prosper without the constant threats of  roaming predators hiding in the swamp. The town’s  main food source was fishing as first attempts at agri -  culture did not prove as productive as they would have  wished.  As population increased, settlers were sent farther  into the land to establish new villages. Meanwhile, Vi -  nimras focused on shipwriting. Whales and other siz -  able fish have been sighted but the small boats were  not sturdy enough to face the turbulent sea. A large  shipyard was built to explore the waters further south.  Their seamanship allowed them to harvest the high  sea, bringing lots of seafood back to feed the hungry  mouths. Wrovenish ships are rivaled only by the new  Sivenish fleet.  Centuries later, the city has grown to the capital of  the Wroven Kingdom. The queen’s castle stands in the  middle of the settlement, with circle-shaped roads built  around it, each circle being larger than the previous  ones. Each circle has a fortification, dividing the city  into fortified districts that can be isolated from each  other.  Vinimras’ architecture, like most of Wrovenish vil -  lages is apart from the rest of the world. Inspired by  their legacy with the creatures from the swamp, many  of its greatest buildings have large arches, stone carving  of heroes, gargoyles, and their fences are complex with  spear-shaped tips.  Dolumeniro  Population:   1,500  Ruler:   Countess Kythaela Liafiel  Rarity Modifier:   +2  Dolumeniro, or the “Bastion of Lost Souls” started out  as a haven for those ones fleeing the Midnight Moun -  tains. Wrovenishans had a rough beginning in Eguras  and that influenced many of the names they gave to  landmarks and settlements and Dolumeniro is a per -  fect example.  The city took roots in the swamp, where the freed  slaves had stopped walking from exhaustion. Seeing  no suitable land, they settled there, building huts and  humble wooden houses on stilts. The community grew  in size and quickly needed fortifications to keep the first  monsters to appear in the area at bay. Rocks were scarce  so wooden pikes were erected around the village.  The town was never meant to serve as a long term  settlement. Its purpose was to provide a safe place to  rest until explorers found a more suitable place. It took  time and the Wrovenishan became good at navigat -  ing the treacherous swamps. But in time, the explorers  found more welcoming lands further south. By then,  some people had only seen the swamp in their life and  refused to leave. Still many of them tried their luck in  the weird lands that were grasslands and coast, where  the swamp’s smells and wetness was not a thing.  For years, the Liafel family lived outside the swamp  and a castle was erected in their coastal town, leav -  ing Dolumeniro as a remote settlement for the stub -  born and those that failed to adapt to living outside the  swamp. Over the years, more monsters seemed to come  closer to the village as it seemed to draw them and thus  Dolumeniro became a rampart for the rest of the king -  dom. The town has seen the most monster activity of  all Eguras. The king ordered the relocation of resources  there to make it a real bulwark against what lurks in the  darkness.  Since then, the landscape has changed. A castle was  erected in the swamp to hold a garrison with a suit -

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   39  able training ground. Dolumeniro is divided into dis -  tricts, each with their own fortifications. Districts are  connected through bridges with gates at both ends to  ensure that should a section fall, the rest of the city is  still protected.  People traveling to Dolumeniro are left with an im -  pression of having crossed the veil between Eguras and  Lilithia’s domain. The swamp is inhospitable at best and  natural predators lurk in the shallow waters. Add to  this the occasional aberration coming down the moun -  tain and the fog covering the region half the time, the  bastion is a displeasing sight to outsiders. The harsh life  the people live there led to making monster hunting a  trademark skill of the inhabitants of Dolumeniro.  Beside having memories of surely risking their life,  outsiders’ stories tell about the unusual lights from the  city. Being eternally wet, the swamps is not generous  in combustible material for providing fire. Fortunately,  the swamp has a native insect that the inhabitants call  wisp scarabs. These flying insects are the size of mice  and are at the bottom of the swamp’s food chain. The  males have an organ called wisp’s gem. This organ  glows with a purplish light during nighttime and is in -  tended to attract females. The glow is so strong that it  lights the whole beetle. Wrovenishans farm these crea -  tures and extract their glowing organ, which looks like  a small gemstone. Outside the beetle’s body, the light is  stronger and provides light equivalent to a torch. Sadly,  wisp’s gems do not light for long after being extracted  and dims after a day or two. Still, the city relies on them  to provide light at night. It gives it an eerie look when  you approach the city after sunset as you can see purple  lights coming out of windows and lanterns. Some even  wear armor and jewelry with sockets to insert a wisp’s  heart. This way, they have their hands free while carry -  ing a light source around.  Countess Kythaela Liafiel is the actual ruler of Do -  lumeniro. She is the queen’s cousin. A few years ago,  Kythaela was out in the swamp hunting down a vile  creature that abducted some kids. Along with her band  of hunters, she tracked the monster far into the swamp.  They were ambushed and Kythaela’s group was slaugh -  tered. The following day, she rose from the dead as a  grave walker. She pursued the hunt and killed the crea -  ture, rescuing the children.  Returning to the village, she had to plan how the fu -  ture events would affect her reign. She decided to play  falling sick and retired in her castle. She dyed her hair  to cover the fact it was slowly losing its color, turning  white. Her mother suffered from cataracts and she de -  cided to ride on the fact that the disease could have  been passed down. Over the next months, Kythael’s  image went from a valiant warrior leader to a wise yet  frail and weak woman. She played up the blindness  since then and even had her servants read her impor -  tant documents. She is still very knowledgeable and  an able leader. What people ignore is that under her  frail looking disguise, she could outmatch any capable  knight. Only queen Viessa is aware of her cousin’s state.  She will keep her secret since even as an undead, she  gets the job done well. They do not speak openly of it  though as the mere topic is branded as heresy. Fortu -  nately for Kythaela, the Church has yet to spread its in -  fluence to this remote part of the world.  If someone were to take a central place from Eguras,  say Prophet’s Landing or somewhere around Theavan  or Fegary, Dolumeniro would be the farthest settle -  ment you can find. Due to its location and the way the  Midnight Mountains are shaped, it is quite isolated and  no one really has a reason to go there. The weird ar -  chitecture and features of the city made its way to the  more civilized parts of Eguras, but the stories about it  are exaggerated to the point that beside those that went  there themselves, nobody really knows what the city  actually looks like.  Prophet’s Landing  Prophet’s landing is not a kingdom but a city-state. The  Church runs it completely and also administers the  land surrounding the city, sometimes referred as the  “holy land”. For more information about the city’s his -  tory, see   “Prophet’s Landing” on page 15 .  Prophet’s Landing  Population:   14,000  Ruler:   Pope Abraham VIII  Rarity Modifier:   -1  Prophet’s Landing is the largest settlement across Egu -  ras. It was founded by Prophet soon after he defeated  Lilithia and now has fourteen thousands souls living  within.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  40  The central building, the   Cathedral of the Holy  Flame, is the seat of the Creator’s religion. The structure  towers the rest of the buildings in the city. The pope, as  well as the archbishops and templars, live within dedi -  cated wings. In the great hall stands the silver brazier,  filled with special burning oils that gives a silvery flame,  symbol of the precious metal that allowed Prophet to  defeat the Mother Witch.  Below the cathedral are the   Sanctified Catacombs.  The entrance to this section of the cathedral is kept  secret; only the pope, the high templar, and the arch -  bishops know how to access it. Not much is known  about the catacombs as those who have access remain  discreet about it. The only sure fact is that past popes,  archbishops and high templars are buried there upon  their death. Rumor has it that the corpse of Prophet is  also kept deep inside. Other rumors also have it that  the catacombs would have hidden rooms holding an -  cient artifacts from the Midnight Empire...  In front of the cathedral is a large park in which  stands the Prophet’s Monument, a marble statue rep -  resenting the combat between Prophet and Lilithia.  Prophet is shown holding a spear that is piercing the  witch’s heart. In this sculpture, Prophet is wearing  simple clothes as well as manacles with broken chains  hanging at his wrists and ankles.  There are multiple vineyards around the city, but one  of them has much more success: the White Fox Winery.  Having made a deal with the archbishops to serve as  the exclusive provider of the cathedral, this has given  them a reputation boost. All around Eguras, nobles  have a few bottles of White Fox Wine in their cellar.  Seas  Save for the Midnight Mountains, Eguras is surround -  ed by water. These seas delimit the known world as no  ship that navigated farther into them came back to tell  what lies beyond the horizon.  The   Bleak Expanse  The western coast of Eguras borders a large abyss.  Therefore, the color of the water changes suddenly  from a light to dark blue. As per the stories, within its  depths live giant sea monsters capable of pulling any  ship underwater. Venturing farther west past the Sou -  less Island is considered pure madness and no ship that  travelled beyond has ever come back.  The   Blood Sea  The blood sea takes its name from an endemic algae  that grows on the high reefs. During summer when the  temperature is warmer, these algae secrete some red  substance, giving the water a bloodied tint.  The   Silent Sea  Situated north of the continent, it borders Druya and  Beraug kingdoms. The sea got its name from the fact  that in the Druyan beliefs, navigation is dangerous as it  is easy to get lost within the ever snowing and bluster -  ing body of water. Therefore, sailors would have to keep  quiet to perceive the signs of their ancestors guiding  them through the sea. The name thus does not refer to  the sea itself, but the mean to navigate it.  The   Hungry Sea  The inner sea located on the western side of Eguras is  the most traveled one. Through it, Fegary and Thevean  have access to most of the kingdoms of Eguras. Day  and night, it is constantly boiling with activity.  The sea’s name comes from its position. It is pictured  as if Eguras’ landmass was a beast and the Hungry Sea  would be its belly. The passage connecting the Bleak  Expanse to the inner sea is called “ The Maw”. The con -  stant flow of ships coming in the sea through it leads  to picture the “beast” as always hungry, giving the sea  its name.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer   41  Other Locations of Eguras  Frostmore  Frostmore, or “Sltudrikal” in notrhal, is an island about  the size of Beraug. Most of the island is covered in snow  all year long.  The island was first visited by Beraugan explorers  back in 74, following Jarl Brit Vennerod’s vision of her  ancestors. The island was supposed to be her people’s  salvation.  After their initial settlement was found empty, the is -  land remained untouched for many years, when Sive -  nish settlers landed on its southern coast in 633. Two  years later, Beraug established their own settlement in  the northern part of the island.  The island still holds its mystery as it is largely un -  explored. Both kingdoms are putting efforts to fortify  their positions as peace between them is fragile.  Scythe Isles  These islands were first discovered by Wrovenish fish -  ermen when the Blood Sea was explored. No expedi -  tions to the islands were made as the mainland was far  more accessible.  It is only years later, when a naval trade route was  established between Wroven, Trimira, the Republic of  Vanas and up to the Hungry Sea that these islands had  visitors settling in. These islands became home for   pi -  rates, taking refuge from the Wrovenish and Trimira -  nish ships within the hazardous waters surrounding  these islands. The high reefs make the region treacher -  ous and many ships sunk while trying to find the pi -  rate hideouts. To this day, piracy still plagues the naval  trade route of the region.  The name of these islands comes from the flag the  pirate’ ships hoist; black with a white scythe.  Souless Island  Neighbor to Frostmore, the Souless Island was discov -  ered by the Sivenish fleet when they first explored the  region to settle on Frostmore. A single ship anchored  on the smaller island. What troubled the crew was the  unusual silence. There was not much wind and not a  single animal was found on the land.  Still, the explorers felt a strange   feeling, as if tress -  passing and being observed. They left the island. In the  days that follow, three people from that crew ended  their life after showing signs of discomfort and despair.  No one returned to the island after that.  Midnight Mountains  The Midnight Mountains form a natural wall that de -  fines Eguras. Covering the western part of the conti -  nent, it is still uncharted after all these years.  Prior to the fall of the Midnight Empire, the moun -  tains were home to Lilithia and daughters, as well as the  numerous slaves under her yoke. Across the mountain  range once stood many settlements. Today, they lay  abandoned since the slaves fled to Eguras.  While these settlements are likely to house riches and  artifacts from the past, no sane person will take the risk  of going there. Aberrations and corrupted creatures  roam all across the mountains and the magical energy  lingering could turn a would-be tomb raider into a vile  abomination.  Beyond Eguras  The world beyond Eugras is unknown and out of reach.  The ships sent out to explore beyond the charted seas  never came back and the Midnight Mountains are too  dangerous to explore or even pass through. Still, some  elements points to a large unexplored world beyond  the continent.  Humans have multiple ethnicities (see   “Ethnicities”  on page 43 ) and these have been brought together by  the witches of the Midnight Empire. Many scholars are  convinced that the distinction in people’s morphology  and pigmentation is the result of the environment they  respectively came from and lived in for generations.  Therefore, there must be other places on Sondara were  these humans were coming from.  Based on what has been brought back from the em -  pire’s ruins, the Midnight Mountains are not forming  the end of the continent. Both scholars and the Church  think that beyond the mountains might stand vast  lands where people fleeing the mountains by heading  east rather than west as Prophet did might have colo -  nized another part of Sondara.

Inquisition Chapter 8: Gazetteer  42  Finally, the ruins bordering the western coast of  Eguras are from a past civilization of sailors that once  lived there ages ago. These people had to come from  somewhere and Siven’s rulers think that by mastering  seamanship and with the advanced shipwright learned  from the ruins, they might at some point be able to  travel beyond the Bleak Expanse.

Inquisition Chapter 9: Culture   43  Chapter 9:   Culture  Ethnicities  People around Eguras come from multiple ethnicities,  as various as Earth’s humans. Their skin, eyes and hair  color vary greatly. In spite of this, people from Eguras  do not feel different from each other thanks to their  shared past. No one knows where their ancestors came  from before the reign of Lilithia. From what people can  tell, they might have been brought from different plac -  es across the world to the Midnight Empire. To them,  racism is nonexistent as at the core, they are all slave  people coming from the Midnight Mountains. For this  reason, there are many ethnicities all across Eguras.  Language  The   world   of   Eguras   has   different   languages   that  evolved over the years. When people climbed down  the mountains to reach Eguras, they had to make new  words as the slave tongue was lacking vocabulary. The  first written form of the slave tongue came about at that  time. It evolved into three different dialects based on  the region: Notrhal in Druya, Free Speech in Astala and  Wrovenishor in Wroven.  Since all the dialect have not been isolated for that  long, someone speaking Notrhal is able to recognize  a few words spoken by another person speaking Free  Speech or Wrovenishor. Such conversation is nearly  impossible though as many words have evolved differ -  ently over the time.  Slave Tongue  Back in the days of the Midnight Empire, the slaves  were speaking a common tongue. That tongue was lim -  ited in vocabulary. This was a way for the witch to pre -  vent the transmission of vital information in between  the slaves. It had no writing forms as the empire’s laws  forbade any handwritten forms of this language.  Sample male names: Toh, Mak, Kree, Zel  Sample female names: Al, Ij, Om, Ur  Dark Speech  Darkspeech is the language used by witches. See   “Dark  Speech” on page 19 .  Sample names: Balral, Dazrak, Gogmathag, Lilithia,  Munnaliuth, Valron.  Free Speech  When people populated Astala, they improved the  slave tongue by modifying words and adding more  comprehensible grammar rules. While still not perfect,  the languages have increased the passing of knowledge  and allowed their civilization to prosper. As the popu -  lation spread from Astala to reach the eastern part of  Eguras, the language kept improving.  Free Speech was the name that was given to the lan -  guage, referring to the tongue spoken by those that  have freed themselves from Lilithia’s grasp. Being the  dominant language on the Eguras, most people simply  refer it as Egurian. As the language spread and these  nations became more influential, Free Speech is spoken  by most people over Eguras expecting to deal with out -  siders, such as merchants, priests and nobles.  Sample male names: Arthur, Edward, Richard, Thomas  Sample female names: Alice, Anna, Maria, Evangeline

Inquisition Chapter 9: Culture  44  Notrhal  The first people that came into the north and populated  Druya developed their own language called Notrhal  or “Language of the Ancestors”. They mostly kept the  vocabulary from the slave tongue but kept adding new  words. They also developed their own written version  of the language. Its alphabet is composed of multiple  runes, all of which have individual meaning. Once  paired together, they form elaborate ideas and con -  cepts.  Sample male names: Bjorn, Ivar, Sjur, Ulf  Sample female names: Dagny, Lisbeth, Margot, May  Wrovenishor  People from the south that colonized Wroven and Tri -  mira also modified the slave tongue to fit their need.  They mostly use a set of prefixes and suffixes to add  ideas and characteristics to existing words. Therefore,  adjectives are not a thing in Wrovenishor as their mean -  ing are embedded directly into the words. This led the  language to have long words while keeping sentences  short. People from the outside qualify Wrovenishor as  difficult to master but pleasant to hear.  Sample male names: Anlyth, Arathorn, Dalynor, Tae -  gan, Theodred  Sample female names: Amedee, Daratrine, Phyrra, Ti -  alha  Rani  Rani is the language native to the fallen kingdom of the  Witch Queen Vanasha. When Fegaryan scouts discov -  ered the people from that witch kingdom, they mistak -  enly assumed they were all witches as Rani is similar to  Dark Speech, though it is a less complicated form of the  language. This simplified form was easier for mortals  lacking the benefit of genetic learning of the tongue.  Sample male names: Barool, Judju, Tebec, Yiendi  Sample female names: Diyah, Magmu, Ronga, Youllisa  Sivenish  Sivenish is the language spoken by a civilization that  came before the humans of Eguras. When Fegaryans  explored the ruins on the eastern coast of Eguras, they  discovered stone tablets and wall paintings in the Sive -  nish language, unknown to humans at that time. Schol -  ars have studied the ancient relics, which allowed the  local population to improve their shipwright skills. The  scholars still do not agree on how the language is actu -  ally spoken and the written form is understood only by  those that study the history of the old Sivenish civili -  zation. The written form is made from a vast array of  hieroglyphs.

Witchborn as an Archetype  With grave walkers, vampires and werewolves  being an option you can select after character  creation, that brings the question “Why can’t  the witch be the same, unlocking the witch heri -  tage with a talent rather than an archetype?”  The fact is that even though a character may ig -  nore their witchcraft power, they are still sub -  ject to their Silver Anathema and that has an XP  modifier for the character. Also, that makes it  simpler to manage should players’ characters be  siblings. They simply all share the same arche -  type so from the start, they are all vulnerable to  silver without having to purchase a talent just to  fit the lore.

This also means your character can con -  sider to have a weak empathic link to a victim for which  they did not have any. In addition, if your character al -  ready had a Major Empathic link, they may decrease  the difficulty one more time, for a total of three.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  68  Chapter 4:   Gear  P eople of Eguras use a lot of equipment. Each section  of this chapter will introduce new gear, as well as list -  ing the available gear from the official source books.  The silver crown is the official currency of the nine  kingdoms. It is a silver coin engraved with the coat of  arms of the kingdom where it was minted and is about  one inch in diameter.  Item Qualities  Inquisition   introduces a new item quality, Silver. All the  existing qualities from the   Genesys Core Rulebook   are  used within this setting.  Silver (Active & Passive)  Armor with the Silver item quality increases the ar -  mor’s encumbrance value by 1. In addition, your char -  acter adds   b   to Athletics, Coordination, Riding, and  Stealth checks they make while wearing this armor.  Against natural attacks of supernatural creatures, such  as a werewolf ’s claws or a vampire’s bite, increase the  defense rating of the armor by 1 and the soak by 1.  Weapons with the Silver item quality increase their  Critical rating by 1 against humans and animals.  Against witches and supernatural beings, if the attack  inflicted a wound (after soak has been applied), you can  spend   aa   on the check to inflict damage over time.  At the start of the target’s turn, they suffer 2 wounds.  This effect last for 2 rounds, for a total of 4 wounds suf -  fered. This damage do not stack with itself should it be  triggered multiple times.  It is possible to use alchemical silver ammunition  such as silver arrows. These use the same rules as the  Extra Quivers item (See page 100 of   Realms of Terri -  noth ). To shoot silver ammunition, you simply have to  declare it when attacking but before rolling the combat  check. On a check generating   hh   or   d , your charac -  ter run out of silver ammunition.  Melee Weapons  Many of the weapons used across Eguras were simple  tools that found a second use as a mean to inflict death  upon others, while others were greatly inspired by  their mundane counterparts. For game purpose, these  weapons work the same whether they were designed as  a tool or a weapon.  Axe  The axe is one of the most common tools across Eguras  as everyone need wood, whether to build or to provide  heat. For the low ranked people such as peasants and  serf, axes are one of the deadliest weapons they can get  their hands on. That does not make it less lethal than a  sharpened sword and is as good as anything else to fend  off invaders.  Silver versus Burn  The Burn item quality from   Genesys Core Rule -  book   serves the same purpose of the new Silver  quality: Inflicting damage over time.  The need for this new quality is that most Super -  natural beings have high Soak value. Therefore,  most weapons would not have a base damage  high enough to bypass the target’s soak, making  Burn useless.  With this new quality, the target is sure to suffer  wounds when the quality is triggered.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear   69  Axes come in variety of styles and size. The most  common is a two-handed, single bladed weapon, most -  ly used to cut down lumber. Axes are popular for their  deadly blades and are easy to come by. Therefore, many  brigands and scum arm themselves with such weapons.  The biggest of them, the greataxe, requires great physi -  cal strength as the weapon is one of the heaviest you  can find. The people from Druya are really fond of the  giant-sized axes, as are the monsters hunters that need  the deadliest weapons around to strike down the resil -  ient atrocities they get to deal with.  Cestus  The cestus is more of a gladiatorial weapon than an  actual weapon of war. It was made famous mostly in  Caslun’s stadium, where gladiator matches first made  their appearance. Still, thugs and brigands will use  cestuses for intimidating and killing but soldiers and  knights tend to favor military weapons.  Dagger  Larger than a simple knife, the dagger was designed as  a lethal weapon. While not as efficient as a sword, it is  small enough to go unnoticed even to vigilant eyes. Ev -  ery adventurer and aristocrat is likely to carry a dagger  as a backup weapon.  Your character can stab or slash with a dagger us -  ing the profile in   Table 2.4-1: Melee Weapons   on page  69 , or they can throw one using the following profile:  (Ranged; Damage +2; Critical 3; Range [Short]; Accu -  rate 1, Limited Ammo 1).

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  70  Flail  The flail, at its core, is a farmer’s tool. It was first used as  a weapon by the people of Thevean when Astala tried  to crush them for rebelling during the Astala-Fegary  war. Since then, the tool evolved into a weapon of war.  The wooden end has been replaced by heavy iron balls.  Using a flail properly in battle demands high strength  and coordination. For one capable of swirling the flail  without hurting themselves, this weapon proves deadly  for their foes.  Halberd  The halberd is a common weapon. Efficient, deadly  and not that expensive, it is able to pierce through the  thickest armor while still offering defensive capabili -  ties. Many lords will have their full time enforcers wield  such a weapon.  Katar  The katar is a weapon that is originates with the Ra -  nie people from the Republic of Vanas. These weapons  were mostly wielded by the assassins and elite forces.  Since Ranie became the republic, this weapon has be -  come less common.  Lance  The iconic weapon of the knights of the nine kingdoms,  these weapons are too heavy to be used while standing  on the ground. The knights use these weapons when  riding on horseback and making use of the speed of  their mount to land a devastating blow. Once the ini -  tial charge has been made, knights better sheathe their  lance and draw their smaller weapons to continue to  fight.  Beside their lethal usage, lances are also used in joust,  where two knights engage in a mock fight where the  goal is to knock the other off their horse. While joist  are normally non lethal fights, death is not inevitable as  these weapons, even with a blunt head, remain danger -  ously effective.  A lance can only be used while mounted and can  only be used to attack immediately after performing a  maneuver to engage the target.  Mace  More deadly than a simple club while less elaborate  than military weaponry like swords and halberds,  the mace is a common weapon all across Eguras. The  weapon consists of a wooden haft and ends with a met -  al part, sometimes studded or spiked, and sometimes  plain. Relatively cheap to make, maces are often used  by brigands and highway bandits.  Military Pick  An evolved version of the pickaxe, this weapon can  pierce the most resistant armor. Smaller than the min -  ing pick, it only has a single spike coming from the  head. Despite its lethality and puncture capabilities, the  weapon is mostly considered a tool and is not as popu -  lar as spears, axes and swords. Therefore, the military  picks are mostly used by militia units rather than career  warriors and knights.  Pike  The pike is a basically a halberd with a really long  handle. These were designed to counter cavalry as  the weapon can strike them while staying out of arm’s  reach. The weapon’s size prevents it from being used it  in close combat. The best use for this weapon is hav -  ing pikemen at the frontline waiting for the mounted  soldiers to charge in. As soon as the pike find its mark,  the pikeman would drop it and draw a weapon more  adapted to engage into the melee. The pike also found  Changes to existing Weapons  Pierce Quality  Despite the quality name, the ability to strike  through armor is something that bludgeoning  weapons excelled at. For this reason, the Flail  and Mace now have a Pierce rating of 1, while  the Warhammer has a Pierce rating of 2. Their  prices have been adjusted accordingly.  Rarity  While the sword is common in fantasy settings,  it is mostly a noble’s weapon in   Inquisition   and  thus less people have access to them. Most war -  riors wield axes, maces or spear in combat. For  this reason, the sword’s rarity rating increased  from 2 to 4 and the greatsword’s went from 4  to 6.  War Hammer  In addition to getting Pierce quality, the Con -  cussive quality has been exchanged for Sunder.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear   71  a use for monster hunters that prefer to keep their tar -  get at bay. Many creatures have a large array of natural  weaponry and keeping far away from them sometimes  means the difference between life and death.  A pike can be used to make melee attacks against  targets at short range (the difficulty remains   Average  [ dd ]) , but it cannot be used to attack engaged targets.  Pitchfork  Designed as a farmer’s tool, the pitchfork often finds  itself a martial use to fend off wild animals or hunting  down a local witch. While it can cause grievous inju -  ries, it is heavy and the handle was not designed with  the purpose of combat thrusting, making it less effec -  tive than martial weapons.  Shield  Shields are used all around Eguras. They are easy to  use make and relatively cheap to make, making them  part of most warriors’ arsenal. Every culture has their  own way to craft their shield. People from Beraug and  Druya tend to craft round wooden shields while central  Eguras adopted the heater shield. These generally bear  the coat of arms of the wielder’s allegiance of family.  Spear  The light spear is the most common of all martial  weapon. Cheap to make and still deadly, lords all  around Eguras keep a stock of these weapons to arm  their people should they muster conscripts. Spears vary  in length depending on whether they were intended to  be used with a shield or two-handed.  In addition, the light spear serves as a religious  weapon as Prophet used such weapon to defeat Li -  lithia. Therefore, many of the Inquisitorium’s recruits  are using spears. Higher ranked templars will still favor  swords made from alchemical silver.  Your character can thrust or stab with a light spear  using the profile in   Table 2.4–1: Melee Weapons   on  page   69 , or they can throw one using the following  profile: (Ranged; Damage +2; Critical 4; Range [Short];  Accurate 1, Limited Ammo 1).  Sword  The sword is the iconic weapon of nobles. Unlike other  weapons, swords are branded as combat weapons and  those who carry these are expected to be trained war -  riors. Swords will vary greatly in shape and style as  per their origin. People from Astala, Fegary, Theavan  and Siven tend to have elegant swords. They have sym -  metrical guard and straight blade. Druya and Beraug  produce larger bladed sword and the tip is generally  less prominent, focusing on powerful slashes rather  than thrusts. In the south, people from Wroven and  Trimira produce masterpieces. The swords’ guard are  often decorated in inlaid precious stones and the blades  are generally carved with a character’s values and oaths.  Finally, the Ranie people are producing lighter, curved  blades. Since the Egurians took over, these weapons  have became rarer. Despite their different styles and  origin, all swords work the same way for combat.  While most swords were designed to use one hand -  ed, some of them are heavier with a longer blade. These  greatswords are deadly weapons but due to the diffi -  culty of wielding such blades with accuracy, they are  not as common as their lighter counterparts.  Staff  The simplest of weapons, staves are mostly used as  walking sticks. While not as lethal as military weap -  onry, staves can serve to deflect incoming blows thanks  to their size and low weight.  War Hammer  Inspired by the blacksmith’s tool, these heavy weapons  are devastating. They will wound even the most pro -  tected warrior, shattering armor and shield. The quan -  tity of metal needed to craft one makes them expensive  and rare. Even more, the strength one requires to wield  it efficiently in battle make it uncommon. A fighter  swinging such weapon in combat would likely inspire  fear on the battlefield.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  72  Ranged Weapons  Bow  The bow is a common hunting tool used in every king -  dom. Even average townsfolk are likely able to use one  properly and is a classical weapon for militia units as  they are somewhat cheap to make and easy to use while  remaining beyond arm’s reach. Even a troop of con -  scripts are likely to kill many trained soldiers by raining  arrows onto the battleground.  Longbows are more difficult to wield and were de -  signed as a martial weapon. Only trained and dedi -  cated archers wield such bows. While some people use  these while hunting big game, these bows are mostly  seen on the battlefield.  Crossbow  The crossbow is a sophisticated weapon that came to  Eguras only few years ago. Developed by Astala, these  weapons allow the wilder to strike a target at range  without much effort on the wielder’s part. The draw -  back is that between each shot, the weapon takes a long  time to reload.  Varieties of crossbows exist to suit different needs.  People less likely to engage in melee generally favor the  heavier model as it can reach a target farther away than  the standard model and the reloading time is less of an  issue. Soldiers closer to the frontline might favor the  lighter one. While it does not carry as much kick as the  heavy one, it is less encumbering and faster to reload.  Even then, most soldiers are likely to shoot a single bolt  before drawing their main weapon and enter the melee.  The smallest version, the hand crossbow, is the least  powerful of them all. It is favored by rogues and as -  sassins as the weapon can be easily concealed within  clothes and can be strapped on a wristband. Paired  with poison, these small weapons can subdue anyone  quickly.  Sling  Made from a piece of leather and cord, this primitive  weapon is mostly used by children trying to catch some  small animals or by desperate farmers protecting their  home.  d   or   h   cannot be spent to cause a sling to run out  of ammo.  Throwing Axe  Lighter than a typical axe, these were designed with  a shorter and curved handle to optimize their use as  ranged weapons. Many warriors carry these to open  combat or as a quick way to hit someone at range as  there are less encumbering than a bow and leave your  hand free after throwing. The Elk Clan’s warriors from  Elgund are particularly fond of these axes and many  carry lots of these weapons.  Your character can hurl a throwing axe at their foe  using the profile in   Table 2.4–2: Ranged Weapons   on  page   72 , or they can wield one using the following  profile: (Melee (Light); Damage +2; Critical 3; Range  [Engaged]; Inaccurate 1, Vicious 1).

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear   73  Armor  Brigandine  Brigandine armors are made from small iron plates riv -  eted between layers of cloth. These armors are prized  by both rogues and nobles as they offer great protec -  tion without being too bulky. Their appearance can  vary from obvious armor to heavy tunic. Some are even  decorated, often with fancy embroidery, and common -  ly representing the wearer’s coat of arms.  Chainmail  These armors are made of thousands of metal rings  linked together and offer a great protection. Expensive  and time consuming to craft, these are prized by war -  riors all around Eguras. Some of these are often passed  down from generation to generation after being ac -  quired.  Chainmail is restrictive and noisy, so your character  adds   b b   to Stealth checks they make while wearing it.  Heavy Robes  Heavy robes were designed mostly as utility or cere -  monial clothing rather than protective gear. They are  favored by priests, alchemists and scholars. Still, the  ample robes have proved efficient at avoid attacks as  it can wrap around weapon and help concealing the  body’s exact location.  Leather  Made from animal hide, these armors are common  around the kingdoms are they are cheap to make and  most guards and watchmen wear such protection.  Theavanish artisans are known for their first grade  leather armors.  Padded  Made from thick layers of cloth, padded armor is the  most basic armor someone can get. They are cheap to  make but can still absorb some hits.  Plate  Heavy and elaborate, these armors made of several  metal plates offer the best protection a warrior can  hope for. Expensive and requiring a lot of metal, only  the most important figures can afford to wear them.  Knights and lords across Eguras decorate their ar -  mor with ornaments to make them more appealing or  frightening.  Plate armor is heavy and very noisy. Your character  adds   b b   to Stealth checks they make while wearing it.  Scale  Made from tiny metal scales stitched to a leather vest -  ment, the scale armor offers a great deal of protection.  While not as efficient as the chainmail, it is far less time  consuming to produce.  The rattling of hundreds of scales is fairly noisy, so  your character adds   b   to Stealth checks they make  while wearing it.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  74  Craftsmanship  The Steel and Iron Craftsmanship from   Realms of Ter -  rinoth   (Page 97) are available in   Inquisition .  In addition,   Inquisition   introduces a new craftsman -  ship option.  Alchemical   Silver  Based on the Church’s teachings, when Prophet defeat -  ed Lilithia, he used a silver tipped spear. Even though  hundreds of years have passed since that event, the  Church still holds belief that silver is actually deadly  to witches. For this reason, many holy ornaments are  made of silver.  Since silver is not as strong as iron, alchemists have  developed a process to strengthen the metal to make  it about strong as iron, which is still weaker than steel.  Because of the cost of the process and the fact that the  weapon is not of better quality anyway, alchemical sil -  ver weapons are pretty rare. Still, against actual witches  and otherworldly creatures, these weapons are actually  potent. For this reason, templars and monster hunters  always carry such weapon along with a steel one.  Armor:   The armor gains the Silver item quality.  Weapon:   The weapon gains the Silver item quality.  Quivers:   The ammunition gains the Silver item quality.  Price:   Cost x 3 (except for quivers)  Rarity:   +3.  Item Attachments  Crossbow Reel  This device, attached to a crossbow, allows the user to  fire a bolt that will attach to the target. Its purpose is to  immobilize the target, preventing it from fleeing away.  Once attached, the character can reel the target, reduc -  ing its movement possibilities. Monster hunters make  use of these reels to ground flying creatures.  Use With:   This attachment can be applied to any light  of heavy crossbow.  Modifiers:   Attaching a bolt to the reel requires a ma -  neuver. On next attack, the character can spend   aa  to have the bolt attach to the target. As long as the bolt  is attached, the target cannot move further away from  the character holding the crossbow unless they succeed  an   opposed Athletics check   as part of its maneuver. If  the target succeed, they can move away, dragging the  character along but counting movement as if it was dif -  ficult terrain. The character can cut the wire through  a built-in trigger as an out-of-turn incidental to avoid  getting dragged in.  On their turn, the character can reel the target in,  moving it one range band closer to them. This requires  an action and a successful   opposed Athletics check .  Finally, the target can sever the link to the reel by ei -  ther performing an action to make   Average ( dd ) Ath -  letics   check to pull the bolt off, or by attacking the cord.  A successful   Average ( dd ) Combat check   made with  a bladed weapon will sever the cord.  Hard Points Required:   1.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear   75  Gear  People of Eguras carries a lot of gear for work, adven -  turing and other purposes. All the Gear from   Realms of  Terrinoth ’s   Table 2-9   on page 101 are available. In addi -  tion,   Inquisition   introduces the follow gear.  Artisan’s Tools  Beside   farmers,   adventurers   and   merchants,   many  townsfolk are artisans. These people, blacksmiths, cob -  blers, carpenters and many others, need some tools to  make a living. Artisan’s Tools is a kit that includes ev -  erything someone needs to craft their goods.  Artisan’s Tools are specific to a profession. You can -  not benefit from a Carpenter Artisan’s Tools when fish -  ing. Using a Artisan’s Tools counts as having right tool  for the job (as per page 93 of the   Genesys Core Rule -  book ). You can only have Artisan’s Tools for a craft that  does not already have an existing entry in the table. For  example, Artisan’s Tools cannot act as an Alchemist’s  Kit.  Map  Without printing press, maps are rare and travelers  mostly rely on indications found on the roads they  travel on. Maps are mostly used when going off-road  into the wilderness. They are sold at expensive prices to  those who want to wander off the beaten path.  The price listed in the gear table is actually for a map  of up to one page. They are usually detailed maps of an  area the size of a barony, or less detailed maps the size  of a duchy or even kingdom.  When travelling within a zone covered by a map and  when the character is able to find their own position,  the difficulty of any Survival checks to plot a route  through wilderness is reduced by 2 for a detailed map  or by 1 for a less detailed map, up to a minimum dif -  ficulty of   Easy ( d ) .  Mirror, Pocket  This small pocket mirror can fit the palm of the hand. It  is useful for signaling position, spying or simply allow -  ing characters to look at themselves.  Merchant’s Scale  Every respectable merchant owns a good old scale. This  tool makes sure that the trader is paying a fair price for  the merchandise.  When negotiating on Trade Goods, add   sa   to  checks.  Musical Instrument  Music raises morale, is heartwarming and gathers  people. Whether it is a harp, flute, mandolin, drum or  any other instruments, these allow skilled musicians to  influence people around them.  When performing with a musical instrument, you  can add   a   on Charm and Leadership checks.  Priest’s Garments  When doing their sermons, priests of the Creator wear  a specific set of vestment, including a stole, hat, and a  silver amulet.  When a priest, or anyone that successfully passes as  one, wears these garments, they can add   a   on any so -  cial checks during which the character supports their  goal with religious speech. The GM may decide that  this item does not work depending on the target’s be -  liefs. In some case, this item may even add a   h   instead  of   a .

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  76  Signal Horn  This instrument made from a beast’s horn is hollow and  can be blown to emit a noisy signal. When playing, a  character can emit a distinctive sound up to Extreme  Range.  Tent  Tents are useful to protect travelers when there is no  inn or home to rest. Protecting against bad weather and  insects, they are recommended whenever camping is  expected.  Smalls tents can shelter one person while a large tent  can shelter two.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear   77  Trap, Bear  These mechanical traps are used to catch large animals  like bears, deer, and other quarry. Detecting a set trap  generally requires an   Easy ( d ) Perception or Vigilance  check , unless it was laid to be hidden. In this case, it re -  quires a Perception or Vigilance check opposed by the  Survival or Stealth of the character who set up the trap.  Once triggered, the trap closes on the limb. The  trapped character has to make a   Daunting ( dddd )  Coordination check . On a failure, the character takes 6  damage plus 1 wound per uncanceled   f . The victim is  also immobilized and must succeed an   Average ( dd )  Mechanics or Survival check   to free themselves. On a  failed check, they suffer 1 wound.  Utility Belt  Utility belts are accessories that makes storing certain  items more efficiently, as well as drawing them faster.  They consist of leather belts to which holsters are at -  tached to help holding a specific kind of item. These  belts can be worn either across the waist or slung.  A character can benefit from up to three such belts  at any given time. In addition, drawing an item from  the belt count as an incidental rather than a maneuver.  Items stored in utility belts do not add their encum -  brance value to the character’s current encumbrance.  Dagger Belt  Favored by scoundrels, these belts allow to draw and  throw a dagger at a moment’s notice.  A dagger belt can hold up to four daggers.  Throwing Axe Belt  Conceived by the people of the Elk clan of Druya, these  belts can hold the warriors’ favorite weapons.  A throwing axe belt can hold up to two throwing  axes.  Vial Belt  Alchemists and adventurers make great use of elixirs  and potions and these vial belts are perfect to make  sure one has every mixtures they might need.  A vial belt can hold up to four potions and elixirs.  Potions and Elixirs  The world of Eguras is full of plants, insects and ani -  mals with alchemical properties, whether it is for heal -  ing, or poisoning or some other purposes.  Beside the Invisibility Potion, all the potions and  elixirs from   Table 2-10   on page 102 of   Realms of Ter -  rinoth   are available in   Inquisition .

Inquisition Chapter 4: Gear  78  Liquid   Silver  An alternative to alchemical silver, this oil is made with  silver particles. A character can coat a weapon with  the oil to grant it the Silver item quality. Liquid Silver  does not provide any benefits on weapons made with  the Alchemical Silver craftsmanship. The Liquid Silver  remains effective until the end of the encounter or until  the wielder rolls   hh .  Silver Blood  When dealing with the supernatural creatures, one  must expect to take some hits. Many of these creatures  use their jaw to attack their prey. Monster hunters came  up with a creative way to turn their foes’ deadly bite  against them.  This elixir makes the character’s blood flow with  silver particles. The effect only last for the duration of  the encounter. Any supernatural creature inflicting a  wound through their bite or somehow taste the charac -  ter’s blood will suffer 2 wounds.  Trade Goods  The higher your rank is, the richer you are. Still, minted  coinage is not common as it is in other typical fanta -  sy game settings. Riches also include services, favors,  ownership, influence, trade goods, livestock, etc.  The economy starts at the bottom of the caste sys -  tem. Serfs and peasants work for their lord. They farm  the land, mine the ore, etc. The serfs and peasants are  subject to many taxes. Some are paid in service, such as  maintaining the domain of their lord mostly through  cleaning duties and caring for the building and the  land. Then, the peasants pay a standard monthly tax,  another one for their lord’s protection, for renting their  land, for using the lord’s infrastructures such as mills,  right to harvest wheat, drill barrels, reclaim land and  the Church’s tithe. Lords may increase the tax rate if  they so choose.  After the Baron has collected taxes from his peasants,  serfs, and craftsmen, they give a share to the count. The  count gives to the duke which in turn pays the ruler of  the kingdom.  While the silver crown is the official currency, many  transactions are made under the bartering system us -  ing trade goods rather than coinage.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft   79  Chapter 5:   Witchcraft  Access to Witchcraft  W itchcraft is the only form of magic in the world of  Inquisition , and it is reserved for the few that have  Lilithia’s blood running in their veins.  To cast any spell, you need to have at least a rank in  the Witchcraft skill. In order to purchase skills ranks in  Witchcraft, you need to have selected the Witchborn  archetype during character creation.  You do not need to have Witchcraft as a career skill  though. Therefore, your character does not need to  have selected the Witch career to use Witchcraft.  Witchcraft Casting  Depending on the spell, casting may imply differ -  ent things. It could require uttering a simple magical  formula in Dark Speech, drawing patterns in the air,  brewing some unique recipes inside a cauldron, draw -  ing circles and such. Even though these steps could be  mimicked by anyone, it takes the magical essence of  Lilithia’s bloodline to trigger the magic.  Empathic Link  Witchcraft magic goes through an empathic link be -  tween the witch and the target of their spells. A witch  cannot affect a person with their spells without owning  such a link to that person.  That link takes the form of either an object that be -  longs to that person, like a piece of cloth, or a part of  the target’s body, like a lock of hair or a small quantity  of blood. See   “Empathic Link” on page 86 .  The witch do not require an empathic link, nor can  they benefit from one when casting spells on them -  selves.  Table 2.5-1: Spending   h   and   d   on Witchcraft checks  Value   Item  h   or   d  The spellcasting exhausts the witch, and they suffer 2 strain or 1 wound (controlling player's choice).  This character adds   b   to any attempts to cast spells until the end of the controlling player's next turn.  hh   or   d   The spell does not take effect until the start of the next round, or after a minute in narrative gameplay.  hhh   or   d  The spell is slightly less powerful than expected. One of the additional effects does not take in effect. This cannot prevent the spell from  being cast, such as making the Range additional effect not working.  The empathic link is ruined. The item or body part is wasted, generally turned to dust. This does not affect Hex bags or Vodoo Dolls.  d  The character overexerts themself and is unable to cast spells for the rest of the encounter or scene.  The spell kicks back and the witch becomes the target of the spell.  dd  The character completely lose control of their magical energies, suffering one Critical Injury (at the GM’s discretion).  The witch is affected by a Polymorph (Baleful) spell with the Binding additional effect. Its base duration is 3 rounds.  If the character is using a magical implement, it is completely destroyed.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft  80  Types of Spells  Bewitchment  This spell plays with the subject’s mind. It can alter  perception (hearing, seeing, etc) and therefore offers  the possibility of either masking something from the  subject or having them perceive something that is not  there.  For example, a bewitchment spell could make a dog  unable to perceive a witch’s scent or it could make a  guard believe they heard a voice calling them from afar,  possibly distracting them long enough to allow the  witch to pursue their agenda.  In addition, this spell can tamper with the target’s  memories. It is possible for a witch to either instill a  false memory inside the target’s head or remove one  they had previously accessed with the Scry spell.  Tampering with the subject’s perceptions requires a  Average ( dd ) Witchcraft   while altering the memories  would require either a   Hard ( ddd ) Witchcraft check .  Should the tampering be exhaustive, the GM could in -  crease the difficulty of the check. For example, making  someone ignore the sounds of an ongoing battle could  be made without adjustments while making someone  see unbelievable things could justify an upgrade or two.  Depending on how long the bewitchment lasts, the tar -  get could make further Discipline checks opposed by  the witch’s Witchcraft to break free of the spell.  Curse  A curse is a spell that impedes the subject in some way.  It could be by making them extremely clumsy, impos -  ing penalties on skill checks, or you could even come  up with long term curses such as constant nightmares,  preventing pregnancies, etc.  Cursing someone generally imposes a   b   on selected  skill checks the target would make if the witch succeeds  a successful   Easy ( d ) Witchcraft check .  More elaborate curses, such as preventing pregnan -  cy, permanent slumber, and such are much harder to  achieve. The difficulty of these is determined by the  GM but should at least be   Average ( dd )   and even pos -  sibly   Daunting ( dddd ) .  Narrative curses tend to last for a prolonged period  of time, ranging from hours to days and even years. In  any case, a witch can dispel every curse they cast with  a simple thought.  Table 2.5-2: Penalties when Casting  Condition   Penalty  The witch does not have a free hand.   +   b  The witch is gagged, silenced or otherwise unable to speak.   +   b   b  The witch does not have access to any empathic link to the target.   Cannot cast spells on target.  The witch has access to a Weak Empathic Link (Personal Belonging) to the target.   Upgrade the check once.  The witch has access to a Lesser Empathic Link (Hair/Nail) to the target.   Add   h   to magic checks.  The witch has access to a Medium Empathic Link (Dried Blood) to the target.   Add   b   to magic checks.  The witch has access to a Strong Empathic Link (Blood) to the target.   No modifier  The witch has access to a Greater Empathic Link (Small Body Part) to the target.   Decrease difficulty by 1.  The witch has access to a Major Empathic Link (Large Body Part/Organ) to the target.   Decrease difficulty by 2.  Empathic Link and Minions  Minions are the nameless adversaries and oc -  casions to collect empathic links from them  should not be a common thing.  In cases where a witch would actually get their  hands on an individual’s empathic link part of  a minion group, consider that the witch has  an empathic link for all the individuals of the  group. This could be explained by that cursing a  single individual is enough to disturb the whole  group’s efforts. Fighting minions with spells  should not be made needlessly complicated for  witches.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft   81  When a witch dies, every curses they laid out imme -  diately ends. Aristocrats sometimes hire templars and  monster hunters to track down a witch so they can free  themselves or someone else from a curse.  Plague  Probably the most offensive of all witch spells, Plague  inflicts a terrible magical disease upon the subject.  While these plagues are mostly devastative and deadly,  they do not kick off quickly enough to make them an  efficient way of killing someone in combat.  Plaguing someone requires an   Average ( dd ) Witch -  craft check . A plagued character is magically sick. They  would likely suffer from some aggravated flu, stay at  home to rest and wait to get better. Each day, a plagued  character should make an   Average ( dd ) Resilience  check . A successful check should cure the target. On  a failed check, the target does not recover strain while  resting. Even worse, uncanceled   h   inflict strain. Even  though plagues have a magical origin, they still can be  treated with medicine and elixirs. A witch could volun -  tarily increase the difficulty check to increase the Resil -  ience’s difficulty by the same amount.  Plague can also be used to wither plants or make  them poisonous. The difficulty should vary from   Easy  ( d )   to   Hard ( ddd )   depending on how quickly the  witch wants he target to be affected or the scale of the  plague.  Polymorph  A witch can alter their own body or the one of another  person. Polymorph can be limited to growing a pair of  wings or gills, to full body changes such as turning an  unlucky victim into a frog.  Altering a body is a useful way for a witch to fend  off attackers or flee. After all, it is hard to track down a  witch if they can change their morphology to look like  another individual or shift into a bird.  Minor changes such as hair color and length should  be an   Easy ( d ) check .  A whole metamorphosis, such as changing into an  animal requires a   Hard ( ddd ) Witchcraft check   and  would require a time consuming ritual.  It is possible to polymorph into a specific individu -  al. This requires a   Hard ( ddd ) Witchcraft check   as  well as an empathic link from the person you want to  impersonate. The check would be adjusted as per the  strength of the empathic link. See   “Table 2.5-2: Penal -  ties when Casting” on page 80 . Impersonating some -  one through polymorph upgrades the check once plus  another or each   aa   generated.  Finally, polymorph is impossible to achieve while the  witch is suffering from the ongoing damage effect from  a weapon with the Silver item quality.  Ritual  Inquisition ’s equivalent of Genesys’ utility spell, a witch  can perform a variety of rituals to achieve a wide range  of goals. It could be large scale effects such as making a  river’s water turn into blood, preventing the sun from  rising and maybe even limited time travel.  The GM has the final word on what can actually be  achieved through a ritual. But keep in mind that it  should fit with the philosophy behind Witchcrafting.  Spells should be grim, related to darkness, death, un -  death, insects, weirdness, aberrations, horror, etc. So  while a GM could allow a witch to summon a blood  storm, it is unlikely that the character could make rose  petals rain from the sky. Some complex rituals could re -  quire the witch to obtain exotic ingredients or perform  the ritual at a certain location and/or specific time.  Fixed Difficulty and Opposed Checks  Witchcraft spells, both in narrative situation and structured encounters, have a fixed difficulty. While  these difficulties can be used as written in most situation, the GM might in place use opposed checks. This  method is mostly used for characters that are important to the plot or very challenging adversaries.  Should the GM decide to go with opposed checks, Discipline and Resilience are the skills that should be  opposing Witchcraft. Bewitchment, Curse and Scry would be opposed by Discipline while Plague and  Polymorph would be opposed by Resilience. Ward should not be opposed unless it is used as a trap. In that  case, the GM should select the skill as per the effect of the imbued trap.  Finally, the Adversary talent can also be used to upgrade the difficulty of the check, whether it was rolled  as a fixed difficulty or opposed check.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft  82  The difficulty of these spells varies widely depending  on their effects, and the GM is the final judge on the  matter.  Scry  A scry spell allows the witch to gain information. It  could be about someone or a location. It allows to get  information about its past and near future, as well as  limited mind-reading ability.  Scrying someone or a location is generally an   Av -  erage ( dd ) Witchcraft check . Successfully scrying  a character generally gives the location of the target  while   a   can give more information about what the  target is doing or details of the environment.  It is possible to scry into a person’s mind, though it  is more difficult, requiring a   Hard ( ddd ) Witchcraft  check .  Scrying a dead person increases the difficulty by 1 to  learn about their location while accessing their mind  increases it by 2. Scrying the dead can be traumatiz -  ing for the witch. When casting the spell in such way,  negative symbols can be spent the same war as fear for  fear check.  Ward  Witches also have protective spells in their arsenal.  These may be actual protection from attacks but they  can also ward a location, such as their homes. Many  witches will place silent wards to warn them of intrud -  ers. Wards can also be used as traps.  A ward is essentially an invisible tripwire. When an  intruder enters a protected zone, the witch is warned.  Such a Ward requires an   Easy ( d ) Witchcraft check  and a drawn sigil. A ward remains active until trig -  gered. Should the ward trigger a trap, which is basi -  cally another spell imbedded inside the Ward, such  as a Plague or a Bewitchment, then act as if the witch  simply had cast that spell on the target at the target the  moment it triggers.  When used as trap, the Witchcraft skill check that  follows is considered to have a weak empathic link to  the target, upgrading the difficulty once.  Spells in Structured Encounters  While witch spells can be potent and have devastating  effects, they require preparation or ritual of some sort.  In structured encounters, witches tend to lack the time  or focus to cast the more powerful versions of their  spells. Therefore, their spells are generally short term  and less effective.  Ritual spells take too much time to cast and thus have  no use in Structured Encounters.  Bewitchment  Range:   Short  Concentration:   Yes  Difficulty:   Average ( dd )  This spell alters a target’s perceptions within short  range. They upgrade the difficulty of every combat  check they make until the end of your character’s next  turn.  Before making the Bewitchment check, choose any  number of additional effects listed on   Table 2.5-3: Be -  witchment Additional Effects . These effects are added  to the spell.  Curse  Range:   Short  Concentration:   Yes  Difficulty:   Average ( dd ) Example: Using Ward as a trap  Elizabeth lives in a small farming community.  While she is out fetching ingredients for brewing  potions, she wards her private room in her home  as it contains obvious witch belongings such as ef -  figy dolls and a bunch of blood vials from poten -  tial victims.  Normally, a simple ward that warns her of intru -  sion would be an   Easy ( d ) Witchcraft check . In  this case, she decides to imbue her ward with a  Bewitchment spell that would alter the perception  of the target so they would not notice the witch’s  belongings. Bewitchment is an   Average ( dd )  Witchcraft check   and since the check is modi -  fied as if she had a weak empathic link, the check  would be upgraded once for a final difficulty of  c d .

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft   83  Table 2.5-4: Curse Additional Effects  Effects   Difficulty Modifier  Enervate:   If a target suffers strain for any reason, they suffer 1 additional strain.   +   d  Hexed:   If the target makes a check and generates at least one   h , add   h   to the result.   +   d  Range:   Increase the range of the spell by one range band. This may be added multiple times, increasing the range by one  range band each time.   +   d  Additional Target:   The spell affects one additional target within range of the spell. In addition, after casting the spell, you  may spend   a   to affect one additional target within range of the spell (and may trigger this multiple times, spending   a  each time).  +   d   d  In the way:   When an opponent is attacking, if the roll generates   hhh   or   d   on the combat check, the witch can decide  that the attack hit the cursed character instead of the intended target. The cursed character must still be within range of the  attack. The GM might decide that the effect cannot apply if it does not narratively make sense.  +   d   d  Doom:   After a target makes a check, you may change any one die in the pool not displaying a   t   or   d   to a different face.   +   d   d  This spell curses one target within short range of your  character. Until the end of your character’s next turn,  the target decreases the ability of any check they make  by one. In effect, this means they remove one   d   from  their checks.  Before making the Curse check, choose any number  of additional effects listed on   Table 2.5-4: Curse Ad -  ditional Effects . These effects are added to the spell.  Plague  Range:   Short  Concentration:   No  Difficulty:   Easy ( d )  You inflict a sudden brief physical illness on the target,  whether it is a crippling cough, a stomach distress or  a strong headache. Choose a target at short range and  make an   Easy ( d ) Witchcraft check . Each uncanceled  s   causes the target to suffer 1 strain.  Before making the Plague check, choose any number  of additional effects listed on Plague Additional Effects  Table. These effects are added to the spell.  Polymorph (Baleful)  Range:   Short  Concentration:   No  Difficulty: Average ( dd )  Choose a target within short range. You change them  into a non-threatening form, mostly silhouette 0 ani -  mals, such as a toad, rat or snake.  Until the end of your target’s next turn, they cannot  use their action but can still convert it for a maneuver.  Before   making   the   Polymorph   (Baleful)   check,  choose any number of additional effects listed on   Table  2.5-6: Polymorph (Baleful) Additional Effects . These  effects are added to the spell.  Polymorph (Self)  Range:   Self  Concentration:   Yes  Difficulty: Average ( dd )  You alter your physical characteristics to improve your  effectiveness. Generally, this includes bestial or in -  sectoid modifications such as changing your feet for  hooves, growing arms and wings, etc. While this magic  is positive for the witch, it is still coming from dark  Table 2.5-3: Bewitchment Additional Effects  Effects   Difficulty Modifier  Blurred Defense:   Reduce the target’s defense by 1 per rank of Knowledge (Forbidden).   +   d  Confusion:   If the target rolls   hh   or   d   on its combat checks, the witch can decide an alternate valid target for the combat  check of the bewitched target.   +   d  Hesitation:   While this spell is active, the target must always act on the last available initiative slot.   +   d  Range:   Increase the range at which you can cast the spell by one range band. This additional effect can be selected more  than once, up to long range. Each time you add this effect, you increase the difficulty by 1.   +   d  Additional Target:   The spell affects one additional target within range of the spell. In addition, after casting the spell, you  may spend   a   to affect one additional target within range of the spell (and may trigger this multiple times, spending   a  each time).  +   d   d

If the check generated a   hh   or   d , they must remake the roll on the  following rounds. Multiple rolls can be required from the same creeping plague should   hh   or   d   are being generated.  +   d  Range:   Increase the range of the spell by one range band. This may be added multiple times, increasing the range by one  range band each time.   +   d  Necrotic Burst:   If the target dies before the end of your next turn, each character engaged with the deceased must make a  Resilience check as if they were affected by the Creeping Plague Effect. When an individual minion dies while the plague is  active, the group still has to make the check as the plague spreads.  +   d   d  Weakening Plague:   The target becomes less resistant to Witchcraft. Until the end of your next turn, the difficulty of any  Witchcraft checks against that same target is decreased by 1 to a minimum of   Easy ( d ) . In effect, this means you remove  one   d   from Witchcraft checks against that same target.

These effects are  added to the spell.  Scry  Range:   Self  Concentration:   Yes  Difficulty:   Easy ( d )  The witch enhances their senses to perceive just few  moments into the near future. This allows them to  act accordingly. Until the end of your character’s next  turn, add a new initiative slot at the start of the initia -  tive track. Only the witch may act on that initiative slot.  If two allied witches have this spell active at the same  time, they can choose between themselves who acts on  these additional slots. Regardless, these initiative slots  do not allow the witch to act more than once per round.  Generally, witches do not compete with each other so  it is unlikely to have two opposed witches casting this  spell at the same time. In the unlikely event that this  happens, the check becomes a competitive check. The  witch with the most   s   on their check has the initiative  slot being at the start.  Before making the Scry check, choose any number  of additional effects listed on Scry Additional Effects  Table. These effects are added to the spell.  Ward  Range:   Engaged  Concentration:   Yes  Difficulty:   Average ( dd )  Witches can create powerful wards that makes a char -  acter harder to fight, draining their opponents as they  come closer to them.  The witch select one character they are engaged with,  which can be themselves, to protect and make an   Aver -  age ( dd ) Witchcraft check . If the check is successful,  until the end of your character’s next turn, opponents  engaged with the warded character will suffer 1 strain  each time they are attacking them, and one additional  strain for every uncanceled   ss   beyond the first.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft  86  Witchcraft and Allies  Of all the witch spells, only Ward can benefit  an ally as the other beneficial spells can only be  cast on the witch themselves. Casting spells on  allies work the same way as casting them on an  adversary in terms of empathic link. So a witch  wanting to ward their allies should make sure to  obtain such items prior to combat.  Once the spell is cast, the warded character can move  away from the witch without ending the spell.  Before making the Ward check, choose any number  of additional effects listed on   Table 2.5-8: Polymorph  (Self) Additional Effects . These effects are added to  the spell.  Magic Implements  Witches use multiple implements to perform their  magic. For most of them, they are crafted rather than  bought as they require either body parts or objects be -  longing to their target. Therefore, the implements will  either list crafting requirements or a price and rarity for  the items that must be purchased. Still, there is a black  market for magical implements (see   “Black Market” on  page 89 ).  Many implements only work against the person the  implement was made from.  Unless otherwise noted, a witch cannot use more  than one implement during the casting of a spell.  Animal Talisman  Talismans are made out of small wooden parts, bones  or carved stones. Attached to the talisman is an animal  part, such as a feather, piece of fur, etc. To make use  of a talisman, the witch must spiritually connect to it.  This requires a Ritual spell, including an   Average ( dd )  Witchcraft check , taking about 10 minutes, after which  the witch suffers 2 strain.  Once connected to the talisman, it confers a specific  benefit when using the Polymorph (Self) spell, depend -  ing on the animal part that was used in its creation.  •   Feather:   Gain the Flight additional effect for free.  •   Claw:   Gain the Claw additional effect for free.  •   Horse Hair:   Gain the Hooves additional effect for  free.  •   Insect:   Gain the Exoskeleton additional effect for  free.  •   Fur:   Gain the Hardened Skin additional effect for  free.  •   Arachnid:   Decrease the difficulty of adding the  Extra Arms additional effect by 1.  The GM may allow alternate animal parts that would  logically fit the flavor of the additional effect granted.  Cauldron  This mundane piece of kitchen hardware works won -  ders in the hands of a skilled witch.  When making use of a cauldron while casting a scry  spell in narrative use, the witch can project what she  sees on the surface of the liquid, making it visible to  others. Also, it adds a   b   to scrying checks.  In addition, when used by a witch, a cauldron func -  tions as an alchemist’s kit, granting a   b   on Alchemy  checks.  Price:   50  Rarity:   2  Empathic Link  Empathic link allows to connect the witch with their  target, acting as a conduit for their magic. Without  such link, the witch cannot use their magic to affect the  target in any way.  There are different strengths of empathic link. The  stronger the link, the easier for the witch to cast a spell  on a target. See   “ Table 2.5-2: Penalties when Casting ”  on page 80 .  While you cannot benefit from multiple Empathic  Links at the same time, you can use an Empathic Link  in conjunction with another Magic Implement.

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft   87  Personal Belonging (Weak Link)  Personal belongings are objects that can be used as  Empathic Link to cast spells on a person. A personal  belonging is either a piece of cloth, or some item owned  or commonly used by the person. This could be the  princess’ amulet, the lumberjack’s axe, the merchant’s  scale, the traveler’s shoe lace and so on.  A personal belonging only works as an empathic link  for the owner of the item. Belongings only allow for a  Weak Empathic Link.  Using personal belongings as Empathic Link when  casting a spell upgrades the difficulty of the Witchcraft  check once.  Hair / Nail (Lesser Link)  Hair is probably the most commonly used Empathic  Link as it is generally easy to fetch. While it is still bet -  ter than a personal belonging, hair and nails only grant  a Lesser Empathic Link.  When using Hair or Nail as Empathic Link to cast a  spell, add   h   to the check.  Dried Blood (Medium Link)  Blood offers a better link than hair, nail or belonging.  Having access to the victim’s fresh blood may prove dif -  ficult but a witch can use dried blood, such as a blood-  stained piece of cloth, as a Medium Empathic Link.  If using dirty or dried blood, add   b   to Witchcraft  checks.  Fresh Blood (Strong Link)  A few droplets of blood are enough to serve as a Strong  Empathic Link to cast a spell on a target. Some witches  carry small vials of blood from potential targets on  them so they can cast spells whenever needed.  Using fresh blood as Empathic Link carries no spe -  cial modifiers. To work as intended, the blood must be  either fresh or clean (such as in a vial).  In the midst of battle, witches may gather the blood  of their target with a cut from a dagger or even with  claw attacks while polymorphed. If a Melee or Brawl  attack inflicts a wound on the target, the witch is con -  sidered to have access to the victim’s fresh blood for the  current encounter.  Small Body Part (Greater)  The best thing a witch can hope as empathic link is a  body part, like a severed finger or toe. Such a body part  counts as having a Greater Empathic Link to the target.  When using a Greater Empathic Link, decrease the  difficulty of all magic checks against the target once.  Organ / Large Body Part (Major)  Few witches can afford such a link as people tend to  keep their vital body parts for themselves. To consider  a body part as a Major Empathic Link, it has to be an  organ or a limb.  When using such a link, decrease the difficulty of the  Witchcraft check by 2.  Hex Bag  A hex bag is a small leather purse containing multiple  ingredients, mostly herbs, bones and talismans. To craft  a hex bag, you must have access to an Empathic Link  that will be consumed during the process. The ritual or  crafting such an item takes 10 minutes and requires a  Witchcraft check . Upon completion, the Witch suffers  2 strain.  Table 2.5-10: Magic Implements  Item   Encum   Price   Rarity  Animal Talisman   0   -   -  Cauldron   2   50   2  Empathic Link (Weak)   0   50   4  Empathic Link (Lesser)   0   100   5  Empathic Link (Medium)   0   200   6  Empathic Link (Strong)   0   500   7  Empathic Link (Greater)   0   5,000   10  Empathic Link (Major)   1   10,000   10  Gem (Emerald)   0   600   5  Gem (Jet)   0   1000   6  Gem (Ruby)   0   2000   6  Gem (Sapphire)   0   500   4  Gem (Topaz)   0   400   3  Hex Bag   0   -   -  Vodoo Doll   0   -   -

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft  88  The difficulty of the Witchcraft check starts at   Easy  ( d )   for a hex bag containing a Weak Empathic Link  and increases by 1 for each step above that.  A hex bag enhances the empathic link to the target.  Upon completion, the hex bag provides the same ben -  efit as an Empathic Link one step stronger than the  Empathic Link that was consumed during its creation.  There is no benefit to crafting a Hex Bag out of a Ma -  jor Empathic Link.  Protective Totems  Witches use totems to fuel their defensive spells. These  totems are made out of branches attached together,  forming triangle or pentacle shapes. These are often  decorated with feathers and bones, mostly skulls from  small animals like rodents. The most important part of  the totem is the precious stone imbedded in it. These  gems provide a bonus when casting the Ward spell. The  effect depends on the gem that was put in it.  Crafting a totem is a simple task. While it takes  about 10 minutes at most, it does not require a check.  To make use of such a totem, the witch must be the  one to have crafted it. Once created, the stone’s energy  is bound to the totem and dissembling it will ruin the  stone’s energy. Therefore, there is no use in keeping a  totem made from another witch.  The price listed in   Table 2.5-10: Magic Implements  on   page   82   represents   the   precious   stones   them -  selves, as there is no point in buying wholly crafted  protective totems.  Emerald  When using the Resilience additional effect, the ward -  ed character has their Wound Threshold increased by  twice your ranks in Knowledge (Forbidden), up to  a maximum of 10 at rank 5. This effect lasts until the  spell ends.  Jet  Each time an item is damaged due to your Ward’s Shat -  ter effect, the character holding the weapon suffers 2  wounds. Should the weapon become destroyed due to  this effect, the character is staggered for one round.  Ruby  When using the Attraction additional effect, you can  spend   aa   to force a character within short range of  the warded target to spend its maneuver to move to -  ward the warded character. This maneuver must be  spent before the affected character can use their action.  This effect may be triggered multiple times, spending  aa   to affect an additional character.  If the Extended Ward additional effect was also used,  you can target a character within medium range of the  warded character rather than within short range.  Sapphire  Upon casting a Ward spell with the Repulsion addi -  tional effect, you can spend a   aa   to have a character  engaged with the warded character to be pushed away  one range band in the direction of your choosing. You  can trigger this effect multiple times by spending   aa  to affect an additional character.  Unless the GM decides otherwise, this movement  cannot push a creature in a perilous situation, such as  pushing it off a cliff.  If the Extended Ward additional effect was also used,  you can target a character within medium range of the  warded character rather than within short range.  Topaz  When under a Ward spell with the Witchproof ad -  ditional effect, you can spend   hhh   on Witchcraft  checks made against the warded character to stagger  the witch for one round.  Skull Helm  This helm is made from animal skull. This should be  a predatory one, such as a wolf, a bear, a tiger or any  other the GM deems fit.  When under the Polymorph spell with the claws ad -  ditional effect, you can use your cunning instead of  Brawn when making Brawl checks. You still use Brawn  for determining damage. Example: Crafting a Hex bag  Elizabeth got her hands on the dried blood of the  baron’s servant. She wants to craft a hex bag out  of it. Since the dried blood is a Medium Empathic  Link, the difficulty is   Hard ( ddd ) .  Upon completing, the dried blood is consumed  and the hex bag will provide the benefits of a  Strong Empathic Link. Therefore, it is a Hex bag  (Strong).

Inquisition Chapter 5: Witchcraft   89 Example: Buying an Empathic Link  Elizabeth the witch wants to get her hands on  fresh blood from the local count. Fresh blood is  a Strong Empathic Link that has a rarity of 7. The  GM determines that due to his rank, the rarity is  increased to 9. Also, the price is doubled, making  it a 1,000 silver crowns.  In   order   to   successfully   find   someone   crazy  enough to get that item for her, she will have  to make a   Streetwise check   with a difficulty of  Daunting ( dddd ) .  Effigy Doll  Typically made out of linen and hay, these dolls repre -  sent a specific person of the witch’s choice. Effigy dolls  make it easier to bring magic essence to the target.  Therefore, possessing an effigy doll grants the “Range”  additional effect for free when casting a spell on the  person the doll represents.  In addition, when casting a spell on that target, it is  possible for the witch to consume the doll, turning it  into dust. Doing so decreases the difficulty of the cast -  ing check by 1. In effect, you remove   d   from the Witch -  craft check to cast the spell.  Crafting a doll requires an   Average ( dd ) Witchcraft  check . The process requires an hour-long ritual and a  Lesser Empathic Link or higher, which is consumed  during the ritual.  Black Market  As long as magic implements are prized by witches,  some people are going to make money out of it. Of  course, a witch cannot hope to find a magical imple -  ment in a general store, except for the mundane ones.  For the exquisite items, such as princess’ hair or the  priest’s amulet, some thieves are willing to take risks to  provide these to a witch in exchange for silver crowns.  Many thieves will refrain for getting such items as  it could draw the wrath of the Church and get them  hanged. For those who dare to go forward, these items  are worth their pound of gold. Few dealers keep such  items ready, and a witch seeking such item is likely go -  ing to have to wait for the dealer to get the item.  The   Table 2.5-10: Magic Implements   on page   87  gives the price a witch is likely going to pay for getting  such item. As for Empathic Links, the rarity here is for  a link from a non-noble. When trying to buy an em -  pathic link matching a noble, the rarity can go up by 2  or 4 and the same goes for the price.  For Empathic links, finding a seller or someone dar -  ing enough to be hired to steal an empathic link re -  quires a   Streetwise check , with the difficulty based on  the item’s rarity.  Once a finder has been found, the witch can start ne -  gotiating her price, using Negotiation skill.

Supernatural Adversaries  Supernatural beings are dangerous foes lurking in the  dark corners of Eguras. These creatures are not meant  to be encountered in large numbers as they are far  more challenging than their human and animal coun -  terparts. Many of these are actually one of a kind. The  best way to deal with these are to use alchemical-silver  weapons (see   “Alchemical Silver” on page 74 ), mak -  ing the fight a bit more balanced. For more information  about Supernatural Beings, see   “Chapter 5: Supernatu -  ral Beings” on page 20 .  Corrupted Creatures  Corrupted creatures encompass all supernatural be -  ings that are not a witch or a Damned. These are living  beings, such as humans, animals, and plants that have  been mutated by Lilithia’s essence.  Forest Fisher (Nemesis)  This huge horror is a mix between a ten-legged spi -  der and a scorpion. It prowls in the forest at night and  sleeps underground during the day. Like spiders, it can  lay webs and loves to leave its preys visible to horrify  the villagers, which seems to be its main activity. It has  a scorpion-like tail that ends with a spiked spear tip. Its  favorite way of hunting is to lurk in the tree branches.  When prey walks below, it detaches and launches its  tail-spear. Then, the fisher “reels” back its tail and seizes  the prey with its powerful mandibles.

Since the creature generally  lurks into the tree branches, this could mean that  the target is suspended in the air for the duration of  the ensnare.

The person’s  body has been heavily modified. Each of their arms,  starting at their elbows, have been replaced by a pair of  tentacles. These appendages are about two meters long  and are about two inches in diameter. The tentacles end  with fine spikes and secrete poison. The person’s head  has also been replaced by a pair of tentacles that are  thicker but shorter. Flaying their six tentacles constant -  ly, these aberrations are difficult to approach. The up -  per torso shows facial features underneath the skin, as  if the creature’s visage moved to this position when the  metamorphosis took place. The face shows a screaming  expression, as if the person inside was trying to escape  their own body.  The flayer’s tentacles are incredibly strong and can  even lift the creature, allowing it to move without hav -  ing its feet touch the ground. Due to its lack of a func -  tioning head, the creature’s perception is limited as it is  blind and deaf. Still, the tentacles have advanced sen -  sory organs that detect scent. Therefore, the creature  can fight perfectly in the dark. As for non-organic ob -  stacles, the constantly flailing tentacles detect them and  map the surroundings in the creature’s mind.

Witches  Fallen Templar - Nathan Gibson (Nemesis)  For a templar, there is nothing less terrifying as finding  themselves on the other side of their values and beliefs.  Templars are trained to hunt down witches and they  devote their lives to this quest. But some might find  themselves realizing they are embodying the nemesis  they were trained to eradicate.  This profile can fit any witchborn templar but a sam -  ple story is provided here.  Nathan Gibson was raised by the Church in an Asta -  lan orphanage. Dreaming to be a knight but born in the  peasant caste, he joined the organization as a Brother  and soon after, he petitioned as a templar. After a year  of training, he left Prophet’s Landing with a squad or  templars on their first quest.  One day, he faced a witch and fought her. As he was  about to end her, she smiled at him, telling Nathan how  she was proud of the strong man her son had become.  Nathan cursed her and her pitiful manipulation at -  tempt and slashed her to her death.  But then on the following days, he felt strange. It  seems that the witch was right. She was his mother and  now Lilithia’s essence had awakened in his veins. Con -  fused and angry, his mind was filled with questions.  “Why did she abandoned me to the Church? Why did  she not tell me before now who and what I am?”  As the magic started to manifest itself, he left the  Inquisitorium before suspicions rose. Despite the fact  he was now a warlock, Nathan would not let go of his  quest. He believed in the Creator and would continue  to be its loyal servant, hoping his good deeds would  buy his soul a place to its side upon death. An thus,  Nathan, ex-templar and warlock, pursues his quest  to hunt down witches, using his magic to find them.  While hunting, he would face templars he would have  to dispatch as well. They were not his true enemies but  he would not let them intervene in his divine quest.

Inquisition Chapter 1: Adventures in Inquisition  108  Chapter 1: Adventures in  Inquisition  Time has passed since the fall of the empire and not  much lore tells of its past. The stories of the witches that  inhabited it back then are part of folklore. Still, in the  last decade, testimonials of strange creatures’ sightings  and witches made these long past stories and myths  come to surface. Pope Abraham VIII had to launch an  inquisition to deal with the problem. Strange behaviors  are quickly branded as witchcraft and the poor souls  are tied to a pyre to be burned. The Church fears some  sinister events have been set in motion. After all these  years of calm, what could bring witches back into the  lands?  The world of   Inquisition   is rich in possibilities and  can accommodate many types of campaign and a vast  array of Player Character concepts. Here are some cam -  paign ideas that fit the   Inquisition   setting.  Political Intrigue  Global politics are complex in the kingdoms. Kings,  dukes, counts and barons fight each other to gain more  power and elevate themselves to a higher level.  Players Characters could be nobles or even rulers,  having to deal with all the court’s intrigue you see reg -  ularly in your favorite fantasy TV series like   Game of  Thrones ,   Rome ,   Reign   and others.  Exploring the World  The known world consists of Eguras; the continent the  people who fled the Midnight Mountains populated.  However, it only represents a small portion of the world  as there are vast unknown lands are that are waiting to  be discovered beyond its frontiers. In addition, other  people have fled in other directions after the fall of the  empire. It is unknown how vast the midnight empire  was and some part of the world may still be under the  control of witches.  The players could be exploring the world, looking for  riches and glory. They may be freelancers or employed  by aristocrats. A campaign based on exploration could  have the party venture from deep caverns to dark for -  ests to faraway lands, meeting strange civilizations and  even other religious beliefs.  Discovering the Past  Not much is known of the past until the fall of the em -  pire. Writing and reading being rare skills and forbid -  den during Lilithia’s reign, not much of this era’s his -  tory is known besides what was passed down through  oral traditions. Tales from the past still give a good idea  of the harsh lives the slaves had to deal with, being con -  stantly oppressed and threatened. Witches being the  ruling class back then, there are surely artifacts and old  tomes lying in the ruined buildings of the empire that  could tell more about life before the fall.  Travelling into the site of the old empire is a dan -  gerous task as the mountains are treacherous and it is  known that magical energies still linger in the moun -  tains, twisting the minds and bodies of those who dare  to venture into the ruins. Still, these artifacts might be  so valuable that scholars, the Church and collectors  would be willing to pay lots of silver crowns to get their  hands on them.  Monster Hunting  Monsters are becoming more common as time passes  and the need for more hunter is felt. Characters could  focus on hunting down these creatures. They would  travel the world and listen to gossip, folklore, and leg -  ends, then root out these aberrations and annihilate  them.  Such campaigns could fit the “Monster of the week”  trope that has been made popular in popular culture,  where each session, the player characters would fight a  different monster.

Inquisition Chapter 1: Adventures in Inquisition   109  Enforcing the Inquisition  Witches are a threat to the world’s power balance.  The Church’s whole existence is based on the fact that  witches are an evil that must be dealt with. With the in -  crease of witch activities, the Inquisitorium has trouble  covering all Eguras. Its templars are spread thin, and  their popularity has taken a drop since warlocks were  discovered.  Despite the recent events, most people still support  the Church, whether because they have faith or out of  fear. Players could be following the Church’s teachings  or be official members themselves, like priests or tem -  plars. That kind of campaign is likely going to be about  routing out heretics to execute them. The Church also  has a global political influence so a religious campaign  can make players investigate along all the ranks of the  social caste, from the simple peasant to high nobility.  Fighting the Inquisition  The inquisition is all about judging and killing people  for what they are, or in this case what power they own,  rather than their acts. It is pure discrimination. Be -  ing influential and powerful, it is hard to fight off the  Church. Still, some people could rally themselves and  try to fight it off. Of course, nobody can simply raise  an army and declare war on the Church. This would be  bound to fail as the Church is more powerful than any  single army unit.  The power and influence of the Church also mani -  fests as deciding what is true about history. Scribes are  religious and the history is told as they wrote it. Many  historical facts told by the Church could, at the GM’s  discretion, be lies to help their agenda. What if Prophet  was actually an evil ruler and Lilithia was some woman  trying to free the people but failed, and the exodus is  simply an expansion of the Midnight Empire?  A party of characters engaged in fighting off the  Church could try to manipulate the local religious fig -  ures such as priests and bishops by corrupting or even  blackmailing them. They could sabotage the Inquisito -  rium’s efforts and maybe even try to rally witches on  their side. They could work to uncover a religious con -  spiracy spread by the Church for ages. A party includ -  ing a witch that fights the Church may also be looking  to free witches from the Inquisition and integrating  them as part of the society.  Mastering Witchcraft  As a new form of magic introduced in this campaign  setting, Witchcraft is appealing for players wanting to  play something different. Playing a witch character can  be a challenge since they have to hide from the inquisi -  tors. Since people are likely to denounce them, witches  try to keep themselves under the radar of everybody.  Witches adventuring along other characters have to  either trust them with their secret or keep their true  nature a mystery.  A witch character may want to discover their full  potential, seeking out for other witches. The character  might want to accomplish a specific ritual, requiring  rare and exotic ingredients, and travelling to dangerous  and long forgotten places.

Inquisition Chapter 2: The Church  110  Chapter 2: The   Church  Inquisition   offers multiple adventure styles from war -  fare to political intrigue, monster hunting to witch  tracking, etc. Whatever the goal of the adventure, the  inquisition theme should always be present as it defines  the present days of Eguras. So even if the PCs are not  directly involved in either side of the Inquisition, the  characters should still witness the impact the inquisi -  tion has on people.  It should not be that uncommon when arriving in  a small community to have the people being suspi -  cious unless the PCs are not strangers. Every once in  a while, the local priest would make a public event of  burning down a witch and hanging anyone that helped  her remain hidden even though all these people might  actually be innocent. Most people are glad the Church  wants to protect them from the evil witches, until they  are misjudged as witches themselves. In the end, people  try their best to act normal, and are constantly looking  at others to see if their neighbors are actually witches.  The Church see themselves as the main authority in  witch hunting and will not approve of PCs taking too  much initiative unless they are officially affiliated with  them.  Church is Evil  Over the course of their adventuring career, player  characters should have seen their share of witch execu -  tions, including the innocents that got mixed in the lot.  Opposing the Church in public should be punished  with death, either through hanging or torture as the  Church will not let anything sabotage their reputation.  Even in private, players should be careful when telling a  priest or bishop they are wrong and proof is mandatory  to protect themselves of being accused of heresy.  Church is Good  Despite some of their actions which can be consid -  ered evil, like the burning of innocents on suspicion  of witchcraft, the Church is not an absolute evil. Their  intentions are good and it is a fact that without them,  kids would have ended in witches’ cauldron, and others  would have suffered their magical curses. Inquisition  aside, the Church is a benevolent organization. They  care for the poor, offering food and providing support.  All of the orphanages across Eguras are maintained by  the Church. The organization is also quick to offer their  help to war refugees all across the kingdoms. Priests  can also serve as mediator in complex situations where  the local lord cannot or won’t help.  Church is Morally Grey  Having both good and evil sides, the Church is morally  grey and it should be reflected over the campaign. The  GM should balance out the facets of the Church the  players are seeing. They should not be able to clearly  identify the Church as an absolute rival or ally. Even a  witch on the run might receive help from the Church  to get food and basic medicine, should they manage to  hide their magical powers.  A templar on the other side might be faced with a  situation where they would have to choose between  their orders and their personal morale. For example,  on a witch hunt that led the templar into a forest hut,  they discover after killing the witch that they had a  newborn. By the Inquistorium’s orders, the thing to do  would be to end the baby as it is a spawn of Lilithia.  But even a trained soldier like a templar should have a  problem with murdering a defenseless child.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Designing the Supernatural   111  Chapter 3: Designing the  Supernatural  A part of   Inquisition ’s theme is about dark creatures  lurking in shadows, waiting for an opportunity to  kill humans and sometimes feed off them. These crea -  tures are a special type of adversary and some consid -  erations should be taken into account when designing  them.  Rarity  The spawn of Lilithia are the products of humans,  beasts and plants being exposed to her magical essence  and are not individual species per say. They do not  breed with few exceptions. Therefore, these creatures  should not be encountered as groups. Many of them  are actually one of a kind. While people accustomed to  dealing with these creatures—mostly monster hunters  and templars—might have heard or fought a creature  of similar appearance, each should be treated individu -  ally and may not bear the same set of abilities.  Supernatural  Supernatural beings are not restrained by the same  limitations as other living beings. Such creatures may  never sleep, feel satiation or even pain. Feel free to  come up with weird concepts and abilities that make  them different from the rest of the world.  Resilient  The essence fueling a creature’s life is generally empow -  ering them. They must be superior to any natural pred -  ator. Also, most of these creatures are meant to be able  to withstand a fight with a full party of PCs without aid  and should be able to hold their ground against lots of  normal town guards. This is why monster hunters are  needed.  Therefore, their soak value should be high. Keep in  mind that these creatures are meant to be dealt with  silver weapons and that these weapons deal +2 damage  per   s . Soak values should start around 5 for weaker  creatures and can go up 10 or 12 for the more resilient  ones. An average would be around 7 or 8. Even tough  creatures cannot hope to last long against a prepared  monster hunting party on their own. Do not hesitate to  allow the creature to play on more than one initiative  slot to make the combat more challenging.  Horror  Lilithia’s essence produces terrific and twisted entities.  Make sure the adversaries instill fear and panic at first  glance. Seek inspiration from existing phobias to make  them more terrifying. Extra appendages, heads and  mouths are a great way to give an “out of this world”  feeling. Another way of making your creatures night -  marish is by adding human parts to them.  Imagine   a   spider-like   creature   that   has   human  legs. The face could be an upside-down woman’s face  but   with snake-like appendages coming out of the  eye sockets, and its mouth would have so many large  teeth that it could not even fully close. This might lead  to thoughts that under that grotesque form there is a  woman suffering from this unnatural posture, blinded  and feeling the snakes moving into her skull. She would  not even be able to complain as the teeth would make  it impossible for her to articulate anything concise. Or  maybe there is nothing of the sort and this atrocity is  simply a twisted assortment of creatures. But in both  cases, it would be unsettling to look at.  This is the kind of horror that makes a creature re -  ally terrifying for characters. However you design your  nightmarish creatures, make sure to describe them well  enough to make them as unsettling as they should be.  Most of these twisted creatures should have the Terrify -  ing ability, requiring players to make a fear check.  Specific weakness  There are a vast array of dark creatures and they all  share one characteristic: they are tough to kill. Even  worse, these creatures tend to be pretty deadly and no  normal folk can hope to survive such an encounter un -  less they are well prepared.

Inquisition Chapter 3: Designing the Supernatural  112  While silver weaponry is a boon when dealing with  such enemies, it might not be enough. Fortunately,  most monsters tend to have an additional weakness,  whether it is while fighting them or by preventing them  from regenerating, weakening them prior to combat or  by mitigating their efficiency somehow.  While not all creatures have to be designed this way,  you should give it a thought when creating a new su -  pernatural adversary. This encourages the group to not  simply rush into the fight, confident that they will come  out victorious. Also, having them investigate the mon -  ster before tracking it down allows suspense to build  up.  Do not be afraid to design a creature so dangerous  that characters cannot even hope to defeat it without  preparation. If you choose to do so, make sure the  information can also be found by means other than  a knowledge check. You do not want the party to get  killed just because the scholar rolled a bad Knowledge  (Forbidden) check. Bits of information can come to  player characters through witnesses, legends, prophe -  cies, etc.  Good monster weaknesses are ones that impair their  special attacks. For example, knowing that a creature  can summon illusory doubles of itself can help char -  acters focus on the real threat during combat. In some  cases, this knowledge alone is enough to turn the tide  in the favor of the party. In other cases, like learning  that a creature has a blind spot, could provide   b   or   b  during combat checks.  Another way to come up with a specific weakness is  by either making it more vulnerable to a special condi -  tion or making it possible to restrict its abilities. For  example, a creature might not be able to cross fire and  thus could be “imprisoned” within a circle of burning  wood. It could have a specific weakness beyond silver  that make it easier to combat. Maybe the creature can -  not regenerate its wounds while soaked, making a pre -  pared monster hunter carry a bucket of water into the  fight.  In any case, these weaknesses should be meaning -  ful. The more impact it has on the creature, the more  it should be challenging to fight without it. Finally, do  not hesitate to make these weaknesses bizarre and vast.  You do not want to have a hunter carrying a standard  “monster weakness battle kit” and get the advantage on  all creatures they will fight.  Traumatic encounters  While these creatures are deadly, killing is not always  the intent. After all, most of these creatures do not need  to eat to maintain themselves. If severely threatened,  they are likely to go all out, unleashing their most pow -  erful abilities to dispatch their foes as quickly as pos -  sible. But if their foes pose little to no threat, some will  hold their punches, favoring letting people get away  making sure they are broken and spread the dread; they  delight in knowing the fear of their existence will affect  even more people. For this reason, display of gore and  violence is a second nature for these creatures.  This can also serve as an escape for an unprepared  party. If the tide turns to the creature’s advantage, char -  acters should be able to flee, but not without suffering  critical injuries or having lost one of their companions.  This is mostly true for creatures roaming the land as  they can easily change location after such an encounter.  For more city based adversaries, such as vampires, they  tend to kill foes outright even when not severely threat -  ened as they cannot afford to risk being discovered by  letting someone escape after they found out their true  nature.  Characteristics and Skills  Twisted creatures are the equivalent of a predatory  animal enhanced with special abilities. These creatures  tend to be strong, agile or both. Therefore, they should  have high Brawn and/or Agility. Being feral, they tend  to have a low Intellect in favor of a higher Cunning  score. Willpower should be low to average unless the  creature has abilities that mimic magic. In these cases,  the Willpower should be higher. Presence on the other  hand should be pretty low as these creatures are not on  the social spectrum of character diversity. Still, some  creatures, like sirens and nymphs should have a high  Presence as their survival is based off their charm and  ability to manipulate humans.  Of all the skills, these should be the ones that most  monsters share as it reflects their wild and predatory  nature:  •   Brawl:   Most creatures do not fight with manufac -  tured weapons and use their body parts in combat.  •   Stealth:   Most of them lurk in the shadows, waiting  for the right moment to jump out of hiding and  attack.  •   Survival:   Living in the wilderness and tracking hu -  mans are a second nature to the spawn of Lilithia.  •   Vigilance:   These creatures are always on the look -  out to avoid being surprised and hide from the  eyes of monster hunters.

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches and the Damned   113  Chapter 4: Witches and the  Damned  I nquisition   brings new possibilities for player charac -  ters: witches and damned. These two concepts have  some things in common: having exclusive character op -  tions such as talents and being the enemy of the Church.  Once a player decides that their character will become  one of these, there is no going back. This section gives  you tips about introducing such characters into the party.  Enemy of the Church  Whether they are a witch or one of the Damned, the  Church is going to hunt them down. Fortunately, the  Church has no efficient method to track them, and  should they make effort to keep quiet, they should  pass mostly unseen. The ones that might have the most  trouble staying off their radar are the grave walkers, as  they can be easily recognized by their appearance.  Remember that people do not want to get on the  Church’s bad side and the best way to avoid this is by  reporting such sightings. That way, they cannot be ac -  cused of protecting such vile beings. Therefore, players  should be really cautious about who they reveal them -  selves to. Even long time allies could turn their backs  on the character if they happen to know they are a  witch or a vampire.  Should they get exposed, templars and monster  hunters are likely to start hunting them down. Being  exposed should not represent the beginning of the end  though. The world of Eguras is vast and running away  is an efficient way to avoid getting killed. Information  does not spread fast and is not effectively transmitted  either. Even if a city guard witnessed a werewolf chang -  ing shape, the description they could give would be  vague at best and a city guard one village away would  unlikely be able to recognize the character.  Witches  Being a witch, or potential witch, is a choice a player  makes when creating their character by selecting the  Witchborn archetype. From there, they expose them -  selves to being hunted down and as the Game Master,  you have to let them know things could go bad. While  magic is a powerful tool, it is not subtle and witch char -  acters might want to refrain using it where they could  be witnessed.  It is possible to have a witch and a templar within  the same party. This generally means that the witch has  hidden their power to the religious soldier. If your play -  ers are building a team with such composition, make  sure to warn the witch that they might need to restrict  themselves even more. In combat, a witch is less likely  to polymorph themselves to fight better if there is a  friendly templar standing by. These witches should fo -  cus on alternate options such as Scathing Tirade and  Inspiring Rhetoric talents or picking up combat skill  ranks. Outside of combat, characters should not be to -  gether twenty-four hours a day. A witch should easily  be able to isolate themself for a few hours to cast spells  such as scry, curses and bewitchment. They could even  brew some potions in their cauldron.  Another possibility is that with time, the friend -  ship and trust have grown so strong between the two  that the templar embraces the fact that this particular

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches and the Damned  114  witch friend of them poses no threat and they are doing  more good than evil. This is a slippery slope though as  this means that other witches might be the same and  could throw doubt in the templar’s convictions. These  cases should be the exception though as in most cases,  the templar is likely to turn their back on their formal  friend. The fact that a witch could have been so close to  them all this time should make the templar realize how  witches are sneaky and vicious, and that this could be  enough to fuel their zeal.  Damned  The Damned are a good option for players who have  played their character for a while and want some dras -  tic change. They do so by selecting the first talent of the  type of damned they want to become. Besides the grave  walker which is easily integrated, vampire and were -  wolf will require a bit of work on your part as the trans -  formation requires an encounter with such a creature.  The Damned are about as good a mix in society as  witches are and characters should be able to walk the  streets mostly unnoticed.  In contrast with witches that might start the game  knowing their capabilities and have already built their  personality, becoming one of the Damned is a drastic  change in one’s identity. That might mean someone  who had convictions compatible with the Church finds  themselves being its antithesis. If a monster hunter was  to become a werewolf, how would they deal with the  fact that they are now what they swore to eradicate?  Would they end themselves in respect to their convic -  tions, or would they join other werewolves to avoid  living as a recluse? Maybe they would continue their  quest, assuming their new form as a werewolf monster  hunter. Make sure the transformation is meaningful for  the character and not simply a way for a player to give  a second life to the character they have grown bored of.  In any case, revealing themselves to their compan -  ions bears the same risks as revealing being a witch. Re -  actions should be unpredictable and the majority are  likely going to reject them if not report them.  In any case, the Game Master can always disallows  players to play a Damned character if they are not com -  fortable with the idea of having a damned character in  the party for whatever reason.  Grave Walkers  These walking dead are basically intelligent zombies,  rotting flesh aside. This is the most accessible damned  option as it requires a single talent and having the char -  acter die. Coming back as a grave walker is something  actually rare and that fact is a boon to them as should  this become common, so would be cremation as a  burned corpse cannot come back from the dead.  Becoming a grave walker can barely go unnoticed  as the character’s companions likely witnessed their  death. The players should be prepared for this event.  You do not want to have a player character select this  feat, die quickly only to be annihilated by their former  companions as soon as they rise from the dead. Maybe  this could be perceived as a boon to them as their be -  loved friend is not gone for good after all. The feelings  they share should be the key to not have them destroy  the character undead from the beginning. Again, this  might prove difficult with a templar or monster hunter  companion.  A way to avoid this conflict is having the death of the  character unwitnessed. Maybe the team was hunting a  creature in the woods and in the fight they got separat -  ed. The character died alone, murdered by the monster  and the team met the morning after. The transforma -  tion took place overnight and everyone ignores that  their friend is now undead.  The physical transformation happens slowly and the  grave walker should have time to adapt and prepare the  team for this reveal. At some point though, they will  have to wear heavy clothes that mask their skin and  avoid people meeting their gaze, revealing their white  eyes.  Vampires  Becoming a vampire requires being turned by an exist -  ing one. The process requires the character to drink the  vampire’s blood and the vampire drinks the character’s  blood. This transformation is a willing one for both  subjects, unless one of them either forces or deceives  the other into drinking their blood but this is unlikely.  Vampires do not turn people into their kind unless  they can trust them enough with such power and have  the conviction that they can handle it without posing a  threat to the vampire’s existence. The most likely can -  didates for a vampire are their lover, family member

Inquisition Chapter 4: Witches and the Damned   115  and close friends. While vampirism grants its share  of useful abilities, it comes with many drawbacks, the  main one being on the Church and monster hunters’  kill list. Why would someone choose to become such  a creature? Likely motives are to save themselves from  an unavoidable death, like succumbing to an incurable  disease. Maybe the character is the vampire’s lover and  they want to stay together for eternity. In this case, the  vampire would turn the character so they would not  have to live through their companion aging and dying.  In any case, being turned into a vampire is not some -  thing a character would do on a hunch and they should  have a reasonable motive to abandon their humanity.  Since finding a vampire and developing such a relation  takes time, a player should inform the GM in advance  that they want to explore this path. This gives time for  the GM to integrate a viable vampire NPC to eventually  turn the character into a vampire.  While the safety of the night makes their unlife eas -  ier, vampire characters should not be forced to remain  inside until the sun sets. They can protect themselves  from the sun with clothing, allowing them to accom -  pany their comrades during day time.  Note that vampires, like grave walkers, do not need  to sleep. Therefore, they can run errands and make use  of their time while the rest of the party is asleep. Make  sure though that these hours do not take too much  focus during gameplay as you do not want to exclude  the non-undead from enjoying the session by sleeping  through half of it.  Werewolves  Of all the damned, werewolves are the easiest to play  in the long run as they can easily pretend to be normal  humans and act like them most of the time.  Becoming a werewolf is done through contracting  the affliction through the bite or a claw attack from  another werewolf. Should a player show interest in  playing a werewolf, make the party encounter such a  creature on a hunt and make sure to inflict a wound on  the character. Once that is done, the character can pur -  chase the Werewolf talent. On the following full moon,  which can happen as fast as you want, the character will  assume the hybrid shape and go on a killing frenzy. If  you or the player want to avoid the rest of the party  learning that the character is a werewolf, you should  have them not witness the transformation.  Once dawn is upon them, the character will regain  their human form. Normally, people may not become  aware of their change of identity until few transforma -  tions, but you can accelerate the process if you feel it is  needed to continue on with the adventure. This gener -  ally takes the form of memory bits that happened while  on the frenzy.  After becoming aware, the character can voluntarily  transform as per the rules of the Werewolf Talent on  page   62 . From there, it should be pretty easy to go  unnoticed as the only way to reveal a werewolf against  their will is by making them exceed their strain thresh -  old or suffering 4 strain at once. This can be done  through social encounters and the player should be  reminded of that possibility. Losing their composure  while negotiating a peace treaty with a neighbor count  and shifting during the meeting can sure spice up ne -  gotiations.  A   Damned Party  While having a party full of damned player characters,  witches included, might sound an interesting idea, it  rids the game of its morally grey thematic and ethical  dilemas. After all, a group of monsters are likely going  to act as a what they are: monsters.  By having a single character outside the norm, you  might end up with better roleplay opportunities for  these transformations and revelations. In the end, the  GM is the one making the call, allowing or restricting  the composition of such a party.

Inquisition Campaign Setting 118  The Inquisition has started!  On which side will you end?  This book transports you to the land of Eguras, filled with su -  perstition and fear of the unknown. The Church of the Creator  has launched an inquisition and everywhere, witch hunting  makes more and more victims, mixing innocents in the lot.  Inquisition is a dark low-fantasy medieval setting. There, the  Church has a strong influence on politics and most people live  poorly while the nobles enjoy luxuries.  Meanwhile, in the dark corners of the world, creatures from  grim fairy tales roam the land, preying on the weak.  This book includes:  •   An extensive lore section detailing the world of   Inquisi -  tion .  •   New archetypes, careers, talents and skills.  •   Witchcraft: a new magic skill, with its own unique ruleset.  •   Normal and supernatural adversaries to face within this  dark age.  •   A Game Mastering section to help GMs create adventures  and adversaries.  Dice App  available where  apps are sold.  Genesys Core Rulebook and either the  Genesys Dice or Dice App are required to  use this supplement.
